<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. They claim that they make no distinction between CBD derived from marijuana and CBD derived from hemp, and since the state has set up no regulations under the 2018 Agricultural Act regarding hemp, even CBD derived from hemp is illegal unless it's purchased from a licensed medical cannabis dispensary. Scientists have identified over 113 different cannabinoids in cannabis sativa, and each interacts with the endocannabinoid system in a slightly different way, offering potential therapeutic benefits. CBD hemp oil comes in seemingly endless forms, each with a different concentration of CBD and other phytocannabinoids.</p>
<p>Pure CBD oil is derived from the hemp plant, extracted with supercritical CO2 and then refined. However, it must be the high-quality CBD that has been sourced from organic plants and extracted to deliver pure and potent oil. CBDPure oils are made with non-GMO hemp, grown in Colorado by local farmers. However, our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical conditions. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your healthcare provider or 911 immediately. According to a study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse , CBD oil is shown to reduce stress in animals like rats.</p>

As well as wanting to know what CBD benefits there are, people also want to know if it is safe. To reiterate: CBD oil in not the same as hemp oil” or hemp seed oil.” Some companies are manufacturing inferior products by spiking hemp seed oil with a CBD isolate. Sure, you'll come across lists like these that give you a breakdown of the best CBD oils—or others—for your ailment, but each of those sites are devoted to their brands exclusively.</p>
<p>THC is the compound that causes a high and all Green Roads products have less than the federally legal limit of 0.3% THC. THC is also available in many store-bought products such as brownies and candy, but only in places where cannabis consumption has been legalised - this is because consuming these products is equivalent to smoking cannabis and will result in psychoactive effects.

Because of its somewhat tumultuous history marijuana has had with the law (regarding whether it is illegal or not), research on the positive properties of hemp plants' derivatives such as cannabidiol oil has been extremely limited.
