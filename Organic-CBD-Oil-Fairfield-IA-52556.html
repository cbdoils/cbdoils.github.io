<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. Scientists have identified over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids. There are literally hundreds of CBD companies selling CBD online that will ship directly to your door — many of which don't even charge for shipping.</p>
<p>Growing organic hemp, extracting the CBD in the best way possible, and testing it for potency and purity costs CBD companies quite a lot of money. To meet federal legal criteria, CBD oil must contain no more than 0.3 percent THC.

<p>Due to the entourage effect, these types of products reportedly work more effectively than just CBD alone. You can get CBD oils in a bottle with a dropper. Another tip: Buy it in a state where recreational or medical cannabis is legal. Neuroimaging research has demonstrated that cannabidiol is able to achieve its calming effects by changing the activity of brain regions that normally mediate anxiety. CBD administered orally was found to be an effective therapeutic agent in countering inflammation and neuropathic pain in rats, while another found that CBD reduced pain response in rats after a surgical incision.</p>
<p>While cannabis oil may contain CBD, the presence of THC makes it unsuitable for many users.
