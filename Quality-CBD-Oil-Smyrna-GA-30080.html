According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , there are currently 10 states that have legalized recreational and medical marijuana THC and CBD use. The easiest and most convenient way to buy CBD products is online â€” and you don't have to worry about the Drug Enforcement Administration breaking down your door, despite the ambiguity surrounding CBD's legality. The frustration of this simple-yet-ongoing issue is compounded by the fact that, as a form of medicinal treatment, marijuana-derived CBD oil holds the potential to help so many millions of individuals.</p>
