<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. Hemp oil is extracted from the cannabis sativa plant using only the seeds. CBD oil benefits for pain relief work through this system. That being said, thousands of potential customers out there will unfortunately never be able to navigate their way through the disorganized mess of the current CBD industry to find a quality, reliable product. And for products purchased online, check the companies' website to see whether it has that information, or contact the seller to ask the same question. What that means is that these patients can use CBD oil (preferably in conjunction with cannabis) to increase their serotonin and anandamide levels.</p>
