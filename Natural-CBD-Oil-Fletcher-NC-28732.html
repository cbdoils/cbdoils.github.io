<p>Cannabidiol, or CBD, was the second compound isolated in the cannabis plant— found in 1963 by researchers Mechoulam and Shvo. When hemp oil is used and processed by the body, it is effectively boosting the function of the endocannabinoid system, helping our body regulate itself in many different ways.

<p>Any information on AHO tincture, I bought some unknowingly and under the impression of the salesperson that it had CBD in it. But it just seems like hemp oil to me. I think I might have been hoodwinked. To name a few CBD benefits, it provides essential fatty acids and additional nutritional value from vitamins and minerals without being intoxicating, such as cannabis oil or medical marijuana. Strange, that like the psychedelics which are now being re-introduced to help with psychological problems, Hemp and CBD are now back in play and showing many benefits in restoring health.</p>

If you suffer from anxiety or feel stressed often, you could also enjoy the benefits of a CBD oil massage. Because CBD has proven effects on many of these potential causes - especially inflammation, bacterial infections, and nervous system malfunctioning - it's reasonable to believe that it may play a role in regulating the disorder.</p>
