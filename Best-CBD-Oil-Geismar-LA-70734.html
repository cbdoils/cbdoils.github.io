<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. Hemp oil is extracted from the cannabis sativa plant using only the seeds. CBD oil benefits for pain relief work through this system. That being said, thousands of potential customers out there will unfortunately never be able to navigate their way through the disorganized mess of the current CBD industry to find a quality, reliable product. And for products purchased online, check the companies' website to see whether it has that information, or contact the seller to ask the same question. What that means is that these patients can use CBD oil (preferably in conjunction with cannabis) to increase their serotonin and anandamide levels.</p>
<p>However, the CBD drug Epidiolex was approved by the FDA in June 2018 to treat intractable epilepsy in pediatric patients - the very first CBD-based drug (and only the second cannabis-based drug behind Sativex) to receive federal approval. Beyond those states, there are 15 states that restrict access to CBD products derived from industrial hemp with less than 0.3 THC. Professor Mechoulam of Israel's Weizman Institute of Science, was instrumental in getting a medical marijuana farm to develop a high cannabidiol and low-to-no THC strain of cannabis.</p>
<h2>Hemp Oil Benefits That People Ought To Know in Geismar</h2>
<p>There are no cannabinoids—CBD or THC—in hemp oil. Studies have shown cannabis (mostly THC and far less CBD) is effective for reducing pain, including musculoskeletal pain from exercise, as well as stiff joints. Cannabis can also be bred to have low THC levels and high CBD levels, but it's possible that the THC will get concentrated and included in your final products. Now, many people conflate THC and CBD. Broad spectrum CBD oil also contains these concentrations of beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes but has all trace amounts of THC extracted.</p>

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CBD oil is extracted from the flower cluster of either marijuana or hemp plant, depending on the processor. The quality of the plant plays an essential role in the end product quality. CBD products have been on sale in the UK for years, so the FSA has not been quick out of the blocks to act.

Hemp derived CBD products with a THC content lower than 0.3% are legal on the federal level but not legal under some state laws. With that said, if you purchase CBD oil at a medical marijuana dispensary or a cannabis retail store, it's possible that it would contain higher amounts of THC, potentially causing a high.
