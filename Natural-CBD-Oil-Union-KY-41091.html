<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. CBD (cannabidiol) is a compound found in cannabis and hemp.

CBD and THC are two types of cannabinoids found in cannabis.</p>
<p>Verma Farms boasts that they bring a Hawaiian approach” to making CBD products. In addition to selling THC products, most dispensaries sell CBD oil and high-CBD marijuana strains and edibles.

Many customer reviews celebrate the product's effectiveness for minor pain, such as shoulder and back aches.</p>
