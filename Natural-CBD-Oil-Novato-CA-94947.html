Cannabis is a family of plants with two primary classifications - Indica and Sativa, however these classifications are under debate. If you want a broad range of cannabinoids and other hemp compounds, go with our broad-spectrum oil. When the essential oils of the hemp plant are first extracted, the resulting product is considered raw hemp extract. Before testing the Bota Hemp CBD oil, we unanimously decided to take a one-week break from all CBD products.</p>
