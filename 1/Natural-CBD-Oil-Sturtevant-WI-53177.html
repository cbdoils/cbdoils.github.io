The CBD in most products is extracted from hemp, a variety of cannabis that has only traces (up to 0.3%) of THC, the active compound that gets people high. Many CBD products display the percentage of CBD contained in the product, which will be between around 2% and 11% of the total (the rest being made up of hemp oil and other ingredients such as olive oil). Alongside this, CBD - in combination with THC - has received regulatory approvals in several European countries and is under study in registered trials with the FDA.</p>

<p>Questions circulate the Internet at a rapid speed, leaving pet owners confused at what exactly CBD oil (or cannabidiol oil) is. Several studies have taken place, and CBD oil has shown a lot of potential in helping with anxiety due to the way in which CBD interacts with the part of our brain that regulates mood and social behavior. One studied, illustrated by the infographic above, investigated the impact of CBD oil on sleep quality, anxiety, and depression among 72 adults ( R ). This study found the majority of subjects saw significant improvements in all three categories with improvements being retained up to three months after the start of CBD treatment.</p>
