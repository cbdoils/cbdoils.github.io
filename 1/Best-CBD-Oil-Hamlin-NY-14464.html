<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. Our ultimate goal is to create CBD wellness products that we would not only take ourselves but also be proud to share with our friends and family. But there are still products labeled as dietary supplements on the market that contain cannabidiol. CV Sciences products are sold in more than 1,500 health food stores nationally, including Campbell's Nutrition in Des Moines and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in West Des Moines. CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a natural active compound found in Cannabis plants. Incidentally, no cases of toxicity or overdose from the use of hemp-based (industrial-grade hemp) CBD oil have been reported so far.</p>
<p>Simple online search data shows that CBD oil and anxiety is one of the most frequently-searched topics (at least in terms of cannabis-related therapy and medical treatment). CBD, or cannabidiol, is simply one of over 80+ cannabinoids that can be extracted from hemp. Formerly known as CannaVest, CV Sciences reported impressive growth and profitability this year that has demonstrated the power of its products and brand recognition with the CBD oil industry. Of course, cannabis (and all related products) are still classified as Schedule 1 drugs according to the U.S. government.</p>
<h2>Hemp Oil: A Super Food in Hamlin?</h2>
<p>While cannabis and hemp might technically be the same species, they are very different plants to cultivate and are used for different purposes. If CBD is made from hemp, it's crucial to know how the hemp was extracted and where it was grown to determine the overall safety of the product. We'll be taking a look at where you can buy CBD products and how they stack up against each other. CBD still face stiff opposition from people and parties that are not aware of its immense benefits. One Atlantic contributor explains that it's hard to get a CBD buzz from food because many of the products just don't contain enough CBD.</p>
<p>Experts hope CBD may be used alone to treat anxiety disorders or to enhance the benefits of other traditional therapies and medications. Be aware that CBD products can legally contain up to 0.3% THC so this may trigger a positive drug test. Even further, this product consists of only two ingredients: CBD hemp oil and hemp seed oil containing vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. CBD is mostly used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, cancer, nausea, vomiting, eating disorders, pain, arthritis, inflammation, epilepsy and seizures.</p>

<p>A 2013 study found that CBD treatment can indeed reduce one's dependence on nicotine or tobacco smoking. The research into the health benefits of CBD oil are ongoing but early indications suggest that CBD may be a practical, more natural, solution to a wide range of medical conditions. Touted for a variety of health benefits, CBD is flooding the marketplace in the form of topicals, edibles, tinctures, and vape oils. Naturally-occurring plant-derived cannabinoids like CBD share a similar molecular structure to the cannabinoids that your own body synthesizes.</p>
<p>As you shop for CBD products, it's also important to understand that CBD oil is not the same as hemp seed oil (which is sometimes labeled hemp oil). One study in Frontiers in Pharmacology, suggested cannabinoids' anti-inflammatory effect may reduce inflammation too much. THC of course is an active component in marijuana that can help with various medical conditions. Cannabidiol may also limit inflammation in the brain and nervous system, which may benefit people experiencing pain, insomnia , and certain immune-system responses.</p>
<p>It found CBD oil helped the child safely reduce her anxiety and improve sleep. The cannabinoid that does make you high is THC, which is found in the leaves of a cannabis plant. The more dramatic a health claim is, the more skeptical you should be. Products that claim to cure things like cancer or heart disease should definitely be approached with skepticism, as there currently isn't enough medical research or testing to back those claims. Hemp oil extract, which contains less than 0.3 percent of the compound THC, is legal in all 50 states.</p>
