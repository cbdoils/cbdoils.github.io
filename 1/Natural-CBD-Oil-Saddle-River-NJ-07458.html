<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket. Each of these uses our high quality hemp extract, with 0% THC. Some manufacturers are advertising CBD products with unproven medical claims, and the quality and safety of these products can vary.</p>

<p>Not to be confused with hemp seed oil , CBD oil comes from industrial hemp plants that have been bred to contain trace amounts of THC - the ingredient in the marijuana plant that's associated with a so-called ‘high'. Because CBD works with specific neurotransmitters to reduce anxiety and increase the ability to focus, initial studies have shown promise in its ability to increase the quality of life by decreasing the symptoms of ADHD for many sufferers. Conversely, the hemp plant will have a higher concentration of CBD than THC.</p>
<p>So you're going to need to pay special attention to whether or not you are buying hemp CBD or marijuana CBD. Oil is extracted from cannabis plant, then allowed to cool; this isolates the CBD from other cannabinoids. A search of Instagram reveals claim after claim being made by sellers and promoters of CBD products - that they ease pain, improve mood and even that they could be a "solid alternative to antidepressants". Isolates Extraction: a process where the source plant (preferably hemp) is processed time and again to completely separate the CBD.</p>

According to Harvard Medical School , side effects of CBD can include nausea, fatigue and irritability.</p>
<p>All of our Diamond CBD products contain 0.3% or less of THC. However, with more and more clinical trials underway and an increasing number of success stories reaching the masses, it is likely that CBD oil will become a more readily available and more widely accepted part of healthcare. Hemp oil is generally used for cooking or in beauty products. Pure Hemp Botanicals is a Colorado-based company that provides CBD products using only organic, sustainably grown hemp. Medicinal TBC oil, for example, can be prescribed to relieve the symptoms of painful and debilitating medical issues.</p>
