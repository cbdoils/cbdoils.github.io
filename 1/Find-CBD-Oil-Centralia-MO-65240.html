<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. When the Control Substance Act was passed in 1970, cultivation of both hemp and marijuana was banned, making it even hard to research or use CBD extract. Luckily, if the level of CBD is high enough, the psychoactive side effects of THC are counteracted. However, scientists believe CBD encourages the body to produce more endocannabinoids. The hemp the brand uses was specifically bred to have high CBD and really low THC. All of our CBD products are guaranteed to contain 0% THC, and each and every product that leaves the facility is third-party tested to ensure consistency and quality.</p>

No. Unlike marijuana or other cannabis products, THC doesn't have the psychoactive cannabinoid associated with the high” feeling most people are familiar with.</p>
<p>Thus, based on the research above, taking CBD oil in pill form may mean that your body only receives as little as 6 percent of the CBD.
