While the scientific jury may still be out on some of the benefits of CBD oil, people are still using it and finding relief. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Most CBD oil and treats for dogs comes from hemp oil , so it contains no or very small traces of THC.
