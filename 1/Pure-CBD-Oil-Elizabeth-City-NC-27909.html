CBD oil benefits the health in numerous ways, and although it still isn't an FDA approved therapeutic substance, anecdotal reports and, most importantly, scientific evidence are mounting in support of CBD's therapeutic effects.

<p>CBD may also be able to reduce the spread of cancer through its effects on cellular function While the mechanisms are still being investigated, CBD has been shown to play a role in apoptosis , or cell death, of cancerous cells, preventing them from further replicating and spreading. By 1837 and until the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill in December 2018, lobbyists not only wiped hemp from medical practice but made it wholly illegal as a Schedule I Controlled Substance. CBD is already being added to many skincare products, and studies have shown it could also become a treatment for acne vulgaris, the most common type of acne.</p>
<p>A double-blind, thorough study has shown that 177 patients suffering from cancer-related pain and side-effects found relief with CBT. They all have pain and swelling in common, and the anti-inflammatory and analgesic action of CBD means that CBD oil can have direct benefits for treating arthritis symptoms.
