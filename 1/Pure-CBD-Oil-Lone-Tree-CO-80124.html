<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Aside from CBD products, it is also used to produce textiles, clothing, fuel, food products, bioplastics, and a range of other materials and goods. However, it's illegal for it to be on general sale in the UK. Medical marijuana contains controlled levels of THC, which is the ingredient from the marijuana plant that causes a so-called 'high'. Most people use CBD oil by ingesting it with the help of a dripper. Cannabis containing 0.3 percent or less of THC is hemp. This is probably the single most assured benefit of CBD oil as there are dozens of studies that are in agreement over this.</p>

<p>It is legal to buy and take CBD supplements in the UK. In order to be legal, CBD supplements need to contain 1mg or less per pack of THC - the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that causes a 'high'. Tikun Hemp was started by the famous Tikun Olam, the world's first organization licensed to produce and distribute medical cannabis.
