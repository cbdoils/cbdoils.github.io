<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. Most promisingly, in a recent study, one in 10 users reported that CBD cured their chronic anxiety, making it the ultimate chill pill. As always, discuss with your healthcare provider before starting any new medications or supplements to ensure that there are no interactions with your current medication and treatment regimens. Sometimes companies forget to post it — you can call or send a formal request to check it. If the company refuses to show you the lab report, it is a strong reason not to buy any products from them.</p>
<p>The murkiness of federal CBD law, and the patchwork of state rules, make selling products with the compound perilous, said Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, an industry group. While recreational cannabis use remains illegal in the U.K., CBD products with low THC content (below 0.2%) have been deemed safe for legal consumption (as it is non-psychoactive).

Generally speaking, both cannabis and hemp CBD products that are available in licensed dispensaries (medical or recreational) are of good quality. CBD can be extracted from a cannabis plant, but it doesn't have the same ability to create a high” or state of euphoria as marijuana or THC.
