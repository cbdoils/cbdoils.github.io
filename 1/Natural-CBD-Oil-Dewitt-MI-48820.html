<p>To that end, he is advocating a consumers opt for a specific CBD oil product. However, based on recent studies and 2018's The Essentials of Pain Medicine, Fourth Ed., here are the basics (5). What these products seem to be are hemp seed oils that come from the seeds of the cannabis plant, and thus contain virtually no cannabinoids. Hemp-derived CBD products (with less than 0.3 percent THC) are legal on the federal level. Since hitting high-street shops in 2018, cannabidiol (CBD) has been heralded as a panacea for everything from chronic pain, disrupted sleep and anxiety to eczema, acne and arthritis.</p>

CBD products are not well regulated, so there can be inconsistencies in how much CBD is in a product. CBD, though, does not contain the chemical in marijuana that makes people high.</p>
