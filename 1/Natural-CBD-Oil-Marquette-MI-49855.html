However, it's important to note again that, although it's become legal and popular, CBD has not received FDA approval for use as a medical substance in any other case than for epilepsy This means that the safety, purity, and concentration of the products on the market are as of now still unregulated, and the dosages and treatment regimes for specific illnesses are unspecified.</p>

The updated 2018 Farm Bill will remove hemp from the DEA's list of controlled substances which will also increase the exposure of potential medical CBD benefits.
