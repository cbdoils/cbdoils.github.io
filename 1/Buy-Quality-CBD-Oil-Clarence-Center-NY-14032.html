<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. CBD (cannabidiol) is a compound found in cannabis and hemp. Updated for 2020, here are some of the best CBD oils available to buy in the UK market. Not only is it illegal, but you may only be purchasing a Hemp seed oil product that contains only trace amounts of CBD. Although CBD oil is just now becoming fairly mainstream, largely because of the debates surrounding medical marijuana, cannabis actually has a long history of providing relief in many different countries around the world. CBD and THC are two types of cannabinoids found in cannabis.</p>

Full spectrum CBD oil : Carefully derived from specific cultivars of hemp that contain an abundance of cannabinoids, our full spectrum hemp oil products are the unadulterated extract of the hemp plant, including all its active compounds, like cannabinoids, terpenes, nutrients and more. But while the vast majority of cannabinoids are controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act, rest assured that CBD oil is legal across the UK for medicinal purposes, provided it has been derived from an industrial hemp strain that is EU-approved.</p>

<p>There's more — anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune conditions — CBD is worth a look in any disease process that's rooted in inflammation (which is most of them).
