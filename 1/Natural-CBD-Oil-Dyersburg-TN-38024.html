<p>Some of you may have noticed that CBD oil is being sold in malls and vape shops across Pennsylvania, but be advised that many of these products, since they are made from hemp seeds rather than actual plant material, are negligible in terms of their CBD content — and thus negligible in terms of their therapeutic value.

<p>However, Haney emphasizes that a lot still isn't known about CBD — including the effects of long-term use, how it acts on the brain or its impact on brain development. Unlike THC, another well known cannabinoid that has a psychoactive high” effect on the body, hemp-derived CBD is 100% non-psychoactive.
