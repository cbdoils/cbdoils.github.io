This requires patients to obtain a verified medical marijuana card prior to purchasing CBD oil. The vast majority of CBD oils come in bottles measuring either 15 milliliters (mL), or 0.5 ounces; or 30 mL, or 1 ounce. An extensive review conducted in 2014 concluded that CBD might be a viable treatment option for osteoarthritis (OA) pain.
