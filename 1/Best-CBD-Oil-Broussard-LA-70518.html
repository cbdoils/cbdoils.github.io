<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Both hemp and marijuana come from the same plant (Cannabis sativa), which creates a fair amount of confusion. Not all products, however, include that information. While CBD is often used to increase appetites, decrease nausea and decrease pain experienced by cancer patients, the true benefits of the compound may be further reaching.
