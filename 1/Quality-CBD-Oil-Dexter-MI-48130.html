<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. This creates a positive effect on the body's pain and inflammation responses. One study split 177 patients with cancer-related pain into three groups: placebo, THC treatment, and THC + CBD treatment. Because it produces no euphoria or psychoactive effects at all, CBD oil is not addictive. All CBD products sold at Indiana locations of Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, a Midwest regional chain, now carry those codes, says Jonathan Lawrence, director of vitamins and body care at the chain. Another recent study , which examined the effect of CBD on an animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), found that the treatment led to an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which, in turn, helped suppress the EAE.</p>
<p>But, as mentioned, many brands out there make false claims about their CBD products. An important consideration here is that street cannabis often contains a much higher THC content (and thus less CBD): this skunk‚Äù is what the majority of UK cannabis users are using. It can be taken orally, but CBD oil for topical use is often recommended for muscle and joint pain. These tests screen for any bacteria, pesticides, and other harmful substances that can contaminate the CBD oils. For most people, price is a huge factor in decision making when purchasing products.</p>
