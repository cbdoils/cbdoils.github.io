<p>Yet a Google search quickly brings up websites suggesting ditching prescribed anxiety medication for CBD oil. CBD is considered safe, and you should not worry about taking it. However, it's always best to consult your doctor before you take it to experience CBD oil benefits. Just like marijuana-derived products are prohibited on a federal level, but legal in some states.
