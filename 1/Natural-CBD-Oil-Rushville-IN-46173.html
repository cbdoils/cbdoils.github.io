<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. Coffee shops sell CBD lattes, spas offer CBD facials, beauty companies are rushing to release lotions with CBD or hemp oils in their formulas. Much of the CBD used medicinally around the world comes from the hemp plant, and not from psychoactive marijuana. A 2016 study published in The Permanente Journal examined the effectiveness of CBD oil for Pediatric anxiety and insomnia as part of post-traumatic stress disorder. Cannabidiol (more commonly known as CBD) has experienced a surge in popularity in recent months, in part due to its availability in high-street health shops.</p>

Cannabis and marijuana plants have been used as medicines and treatments by doctors, physicians and healers for thousands of years. While the products you can find on Amazon do have the term CBD‚Äù in their names, they won't really contain much, if any, CBD.</p>

It is because hemp only recently became legal to grow in the U.S. that many of the finished hemp goods that you see for sale in America, from food products to clothing to building materials, are part of an imported hemp industry that has surpassed $688 million annually.

Interestingly, the endocannabinoid system, something most people wouldn't have heard about until recently, was discovered through various research and studies on the effects of cannabis on the body and was hence named after the plant itself. One of the health effects of cannabis oil includes the ease of pain symptoms from multiple sclerosis. A quarter of a century later, in 1996, the state of California legalized the use of cannabis for treatment of certain medical conditions, despite the federal ban.</p>

The more dramatic a health claim is, the more skeptical you should be. Products that claim to cure things like cancer or heart disease should definitely be approached with skepticism, as there currently isn't enough medical research or testing to back those claims.
