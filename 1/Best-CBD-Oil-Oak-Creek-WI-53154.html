<p>Questions circulate the Internet at a rapid speed, leaving pet owners confused at what exactly CBD oil (or cannabidiol oil) is. Several studies have taken place, and CBD oil has shown a lot of potential in helping with anxiety due to the way in which CBD interacts with the part of our brain that regulates mood and social behavior.
