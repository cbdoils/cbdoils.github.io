Numerous cancer patients use and buy CBD oil to help with pain and nausea, but the compound may have other, more far-reaching benefits as well.</p>
<p>With the rising popularity of CBD oil for dogs, there's a plethora of companies selling cannabis products. Take note, however, that some CBD oils may contain trace amounts of THC.

<p>CBD products don't activate the CBD receptors directly but instead influence the body's natural cannabinoids to either block off or activate the receptors which may play a role in weight loss and other critical metabolic functions. One of the most popular and well-known uses of cannabis oil is for the purpose of relief from anxiety and stress.
