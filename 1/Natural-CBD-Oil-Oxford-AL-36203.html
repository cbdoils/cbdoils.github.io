<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil.

In contrast, the hemp plant only produces negligible amounts of THC, and is different from the cannabis plant in its function and cultivation. Marijuana and CBD are currently fully legal for both medicinal and recreational purposes in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Washington D.C. In 23 states, it's legal in some form, such as for medicinal purposes.</p>
