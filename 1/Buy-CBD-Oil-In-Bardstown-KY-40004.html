<h2>How Hemp Seed Oil Can Help Your Arthritis in Bardstown</h2>
<p>Basically, HEMP CBD OIL has less THC in it. And CANNABIS CBD OIL has more THC in it. Of these cannabinoids, CBD (cannabidiol) and THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) are usually present in the highest concentrations and are therefore the most recognized and studied. If you've spent any time researching CBD products, you'll know there's a confusing number of brands and products to choose from. With so little CBD in the bottle, it's no wonder these products lack the benefits that were advertised. We'll get to that later, but first, here are the best CBD oils that made it to our list.</p>
<p>Let's start by explaining what CBD oil is. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a cannabinoid, a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants.

Humans have the endocannabinoid system, or ECS, meaning they naturally respond to the influx of cannabinoids from the cannabis plant. For hemp-derived CBD oil, the product's COA would include information on which cannabinoids, along with compounds like heavy metals, are in the product. It's one of the many active cannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa plant. However, within the past decade, they have become increasingly interested in the therapeutic benefits of the other compounds found in both varieties, especially cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
<p>CBD oil may, however, interfere with the breakdown of certain prescription medications. Another study found that even a single overnight dose of CBD can reduce the salience and pleasantness of cigarette cues (pictures of tobacco products) in smokers the following morning. Cannabidiol is one of over 100 known cannabinoids in the Cannabis plant. Our CBD oil is all natural, without any additives that could compromise its quality. A study from the European Journal of Pain showed, using an animal model, CBD applied on the skin could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis.</p>

No formal, systematic studies have been conducted for the effects of CBD on dogs, but experts guess that CBD will have similar effects on dogs as it does on humans.
