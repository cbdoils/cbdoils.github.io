<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. Scientists have identified over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids.

CBD hemp oil can be extracted from both the hemp and cannabis plant, but the former contains3 percent THC or less, and therefore bypasses the legal issues associated with cannabis production. CBD additionally affects THC function by inhibiting first-pass hepatic metabolism to the possibly more psychoactive 11-hydroxy-THC, prolonging its half-life, and reducing associated intoxication, panic, anxiety and tachycardia.</p>
