<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this.

Lee, author of "Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana - Medical, Recreational and Scientific" and the director of Project CBD , an educational site about CBD and its benefits, to find out what exactly CBD is and how it's made. Hemp oil refers to extracts obtained from the seeds of the cannabis Sativa plant, which contain trace amounts of CBD. Four Leaf Rover hemp-derived CBD Oil contains less than 0.3% THC.
