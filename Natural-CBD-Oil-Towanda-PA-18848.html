<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. And provides many of the same benefits as its THC counterpart, but without any negative or mind-altering effects. In recent years, the legality of CBD oil and other products derived from hemp or marijuana has been a hot-button issue. Other CBD oil infused products include capsules, gummies and creams. Coconut oil also increases the bioavailability of CBD in the body.

Different cannabis plants — often called hemp or marijuana — contain different levels of chemical compounds. While the research is still forthcoming, and traditional medications and insulin are still the trusted first line of defense for Type 1 Diabetes, studies on the way that CBD interacts with the pancreas have become more popular, and the early results are promising.</p>
