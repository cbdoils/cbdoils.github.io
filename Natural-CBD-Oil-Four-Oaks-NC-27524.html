<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. The resulting product has a higher concentration of CBD than the raw extract, hence the term CBD-rich oil. They source their organic hemp from Colorado and they submit their products to third-party labs to test their purity and safety.

<p>All 50 states have laws legalizing CBD with varying degrees of restriction, and while the federal government still considers CBD in the same class as marijuana, it doesn't habitually enforce against it.

Scientists refer to a phenomenon called the entourage effect.” This principle suggests that cannabinoids like CBD work best in combination with other cannabinoids (like THC, CBN, and CBG). The compound is also nonpsychoactive (meaning it does not produce the ‘high' associated with cannabis use), making it a safe and effective option for patients who may be concerned about the mind altering effects of other cannabinoids such as THC.</p>

An oil containing more than the legally allowed THC level can also compromise you during drug tests.</p>
<p>Today the cost for high-quality CBD products starts from 50-75₤ for 300 mg. Hemp derived CBD products with a THC content lower than 0.3% are legal on the federal level but not legal under some state laws.
