The benefits of CBD oil for anxiety are well established. Though it is under the 0.3 percent legal limit of THC, it has terpenes and other adjacent phytocannabinoids to support the effects of CBD.</p>
<p>CBD and other cannabinoids found in full-spectrum hemp extracts interact with our body's endocannabinoid system.
