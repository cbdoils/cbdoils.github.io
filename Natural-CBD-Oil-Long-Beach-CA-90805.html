CBD, or cannabidiol, is simply one of over 80+ cannabinoids that can be extracted from hemp. Formerly known as CannaVest, CV Sciences reported impressive growth and profitability this year that has demonstrated the power of its products and brand recognition with the CBD oil industry. Of course, cannabis (and all related products) are still classified as Schedule 1 drugs according to the U.S. government.</p>

<p>With that being said, for CBD oil to change people's lives and reach its optimum potential, a lot more work has to be done by legislators, CBD marketers, and other stakeholders. While many people use cannabidiol to relieve pain, more scientific research is needed to be sure it is safe. After seasonal harvests of specific cultivars, these high-CBD hemp crops are put through a specialized solvent-free extraction process to yield a hemp oil that is naturally high in cannabidiol. There remain inconsistent or unclear rules in many countries regarding the legality of CBD products.</p>

Because CBD works with specific neurotransmitters to reduce anxiety and increase the ability to focus, initial studies have shown promise in its ability to increase the quality of life by decreasing the symptoms of ADHD for many sufferers. Conversely, the hemp plant will have a higher concentration of CBD than THC.</p>

For this reason, you have to make sure the hemp CBD oil you buy is actually a CBD oil (i.e. derived from aerial parts of the hemp plant).

Evidence from both animal and human studies strongly supports a broad range of anxiolytic or anxiety reducing effects brought on by CBD. People use CBD oil for a variety of conditions, from lowering blood pressure, helping with anxiety, and stress relief to joint pain and cancer.</p>
<p>The percentage of THC: If there is more than 0.2% THC in the product, then it is illegal in the UK and unregulated. Online offers a host of benefits, including product selection.

High potency CBD oils are ideal for those seeking a powerful, therapeutic effect.
