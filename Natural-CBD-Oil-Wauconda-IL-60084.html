<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. Again, the answer in most cases is no. This is because most CBD products today are made from hemp, which contains less than 0.3% THC content on a dry weight basis. Prof 'Sullivan points out that novelty products like CBD cappuccinos and ice-cream, often sold at a premium, have so little CBD in them that "there's just no possibility it's going to have a biological effect".

In any form, hemp oil for anxiety can be effective in terms of therapy.
