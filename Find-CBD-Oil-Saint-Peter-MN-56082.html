<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. They offer high-potency products like Super Good Vibes, which has over 33 mg of CBD in each dropper-full. People refer to cannabis plants as either hemp or marijuana, depending on how much THC they contain. Using CBD and THC mixture showed a positive effect in reducing short-term withdrawal and craving and cannabis use disorders. Currently, CBD is legal in the UK, but another component of cannabis, THC, is still illegal.

<p>Brands can only sell their products as a food supplement, and must not make medical claims. However, many consumers may be unaware of the actual cannabinoid content of their CBD oil. The updated 2018 Farm Bill will remove hemp from the DEA's list of controlled substances which will also increase the exposure of potential medical CBD benefits. CBD oil consists of a high-CBD cannabis extract in a carrier oil base, such as coconut-derived MCT oil. Some people in warmer and more humid climates tend to store their CBD oil in their refrigerator.</p>
