<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. Hemp oil extract in the United States refers to the oil extracted from the stalk of the hemp plant. In the United States, CBD oil is legal in some states, but not all. Remember, the best CBD products contain less than 0.3% THC and come from 100% organic, non-GMO, and pesticide-free industrial hemp. They are best suited for the production of industrial hemp, seeds, and CBD. Bottom line: CBD oil has been found through several studies to help reduce depression and anxiety disorders in both animals and humans. Different volumes of CBD oils can sometimes cause confusion among inexperienced users.</p>
<p>Derived from the stalk and seed of cannabis (hemp) plants, hemp oil is a natural botanical concentrate that is high in the compound CBD. Medical studies have suggested that CBD has a multitude of benefits for various health conditions. In an earlier study, researchers found that CBD treatment can prevent 56 percent of diabetic mice from developing diabetes. Anecdotally, CBD oil benefits are plentiful. The product that you shared has whole plant extract instead of just CBD mixed with a flavouring agent and carrier oil.</p>
<h2>Are You Using a Safe CBD Oil in Concord</h2>
<p>CBD has exploded in popularity over the past few years thanks to its wide-ranging medical benefits and absence of psychoactive effects. All cannabis products whether CBD only or hybrids contains THC and other Cannabinoids are considered by the TGA as restricted drugs and are listed as Schedule 4 (CBD) and Schedule 8 (THC).

Other studies support the positive effects of CBD oil for arthritis swelling and joint pain.</p>
<p>A healthy diet and lifestyle is a top priority for such people, but CBD oil can also help. Handily, this means you won't get high using CBD oil or other similar products. When you buy CBD oil that is made with isolate, that means that the other cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids have been removed. While hemp seeds are an excellent source of protein-rich, omega 3 fatty acids, the seeds themselves don't contain CBD, THC or any other cannabinoids. All Healthspan CBD products are legal, safe and independently tested by ISO-accredited laboratories, so you can trust that they contain the amount of CBD stated on the pack as well as the absolute minimum of THC: the psychoactive compound found in marijuana cannabis that causes a 'high'.</p>
