Hemp derived CBD products with a THC content lower than 0.3% are legal on the federal level but not legal under some state laws. With that said, if you purchase CBD oil at a medical marijuana dispensary or a cannabis retail store, it's possible that it would contain higher amounts of THC, potentially causing a high. Products for sale by Ned contain less than 0.3% THC. The tests can be made by the shade laboratories, which don't have the necessary possibilities to analyze CBD products properly.</p>
