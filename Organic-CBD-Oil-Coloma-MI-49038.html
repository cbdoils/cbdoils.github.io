<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. The combination of cannabinoids, as opposed to just CBD, can affect multiple targets within the body and enhance the overall effect. Every single day, people hear about CBD oil and how it keeps our bodies running at their best for the first time. CBD can impact the interaction between endocannabinoids and these receptors, thereby potentially providing some pain relief through this process. For example, in one 2010 study , researchers found that using CBD to treat diabetic mice with cardiovascular disease help reduce oxidative stress (which is linked to inflammation) and prevent heart failure.</p>

<p>Medical Marijuana can only be prescribed by an Australian-registered medical practitioner under approval from the Department of Health. The compound in the cannabis plant that is most well-known is THC. Therefore, it is important to know that CBD oil and hemp oil are not the same and to be sure to read labels closely. The benefits of CBD oil for anxiety are well established.

But don't take our word. For example, in one of the American states (Delaware), you can buy CBD oil with a mixed formulation of THC at 5%. Even at 5%, THC can't still get you high.

CBD from industrialized hemp is federally legal , but if manufacturers make claims of therapeutic benefits,” then the product could be regulated, meaning a manufacturer could be selling and marketing legal CBD in a way that is unlawful.</p>
<p>For a product to legally be considered hemp oil, there must be less than 0.3% THC in the CBD products. Since CBD oil includes the full spectrum of cannabinoids, it can produce what experts call an entourage effect ,” where multiple compounds work together to create more intense and possibly more beneficial effects than each compound could have individually. CBD products are not well regulated, so there can be inconsistencies in how much CBD is in a product. CBD, though, does not contain the chemical in marijuana that makes people high.</p>
