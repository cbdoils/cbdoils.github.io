<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits.

Broad spectrum CBD oil also contains these concentrations of beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes but has all trace amounts of THC extracted.</p>
<p>Research on the potential health benefits of CBD oil is still ongoing and new therapeutic uses for this natural remedy are sure to be discovered. Studies suggest that these effects are due to hemp oil's balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.

<p>Some CBD products manufacturers rely on Ayurveda principles, which stand for conscious consumption as well as farmers' well-being.

Some CBD products also contain very little of the advertised ingredient. Nevertheless, in laboratory tests, the agency found many of these products do "not contain the levels of CBD they claimed to contain." This means a lot of consumers who have bought into the CBD craze are out there getting scammed.</p>
