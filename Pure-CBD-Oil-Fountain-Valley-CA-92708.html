<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. Product Range: Oils, capsules, tinctures, edibles, beverages, vapes pens, and bath bombs. The RASN is a non-profit team of healthcare professionals, and RA warriors who are committed to helping people with rheumatoid arthritis live full, happy lives despite their diagnosis. There are plenty of other names out there such as pot oil, marijuana oil, cannabis oil, etc, but a lot of these contain THC, and some of them don't even have any CBD at all.

The oil is typically tested for cannabidiol content and treated in a heating process known as decarboxylation, which helps the CBD react more easily with the body.
