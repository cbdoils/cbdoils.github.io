<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket.

<p>It has been shown in a growing body of medical literature to assist treatment of conditions ranging from x. to y., while anecdotal evidence from a much bigger group of users suggests it helps them with other conditions too. Cannabinoids, the active components of Cannabis sativa, and endogenous cannabinoids mediate their effects through activation of specific cannabinoid receptors known as cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2). Just like regular oils, the benefits of vaping CBD oil are pretty good, but you need to get them in the right form, form a trusted supplier.</p>

<p>And the more dramatic the claim, such as the ability to cure cancer or heart disease, the more skeptical you should be.

CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content.
