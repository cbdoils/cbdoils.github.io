<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. When you use a phytocannabinoid, you supplement the bodies natural endocannabinoids to increase the ability (the gain) of the endocannabinoid system to orchestrate (think orchestra conductor) the various receptors and systems needed to bring the body back into a healthy working balance. They might be taken for a ride by people who are marketing unregulated forms of CBD and not get the treatment they need,” Blessing said.

The final option for taking cannabidiol, vaporized consumption, involves CBD vape oils. Even though research is in the fairly early stages when it comes to using CBD oil for anxiety , there is already a surprising amount of evidence pointing to a beneficial outcome. Some research suggests that in some people, CBD may work better when it's combined with at least a little THC, says Martin Lee, director of Project CBD, an advocacy group that supports CBD research and the author of "Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana—Medical, Recreational, and Scientific" (Scribner, 2012).</p>
