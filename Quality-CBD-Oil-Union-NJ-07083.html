Hemp oil refers to extracts obtained from the seeds of the cannabis Sativa plant, which contain trace amounts of CBD. Four Leaf Rover hemp-derived CBD Oil contains less than 0.3% THC. The brand's hemp oils come in a wide range of sizes. CBD oil and can help, and several animals, human and in-vitro studies agree.</p>
<p>A 2013 study found that CBD treatment can indeed reduce one's dependence on nicotine or tobacco smoking. The research into the health benefits of CBD oil are ongoing but early indications suggest that CBD may be a practical, more natural, solution to a wide range of medical conditions. Touted for a variety of health benefits, CBD is flooding the marketplace in the form of topicals, edibles, tinctures, and vape oils.
