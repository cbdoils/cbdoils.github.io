<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. Coffee shops sell CBD lattes, spas offer CBD facials, beauty companies are rushing to release lotions with CBD or hemp oils in their formulas. Much of the CBD used medicinally around the world comes from the hemp plant, and not from psychoactive marijuana. A 2016 study published in The Permanente Journal examined the effectiveness of CBD oil for Pediatric anxiety and insomnia as part of post-traumatic stress disorder. Cannabidiol (more commonly known as CBD) has experienced a surge in popularity in recent months, in part due to its availability in high-street health shops.</p>
<p>A small 2010 study found that cannabidiol could reduce symptoms of social anxiety in people with social anxiety disorder (SAD). CBD oil is non-psychoactive and non-intoxicating, which means it can be safely consumed by people of all ages. CBD's anti-anxiety effect is why many in the cannabis community talk about how CBD relieves paranoia, although that is not scientifically proven yet. One of the most celebrated health benefits of CBD oil is its analgesic (pain relieving) effects. Of course, price will always be a determining factor in the CBD products you choose to use.</p>

The array of pure CBD oil products available for purchase range in potency, consumption method and price, to meet the needs of everyone.</p>
<p>Much of this research is still in the early phases (with a lot of room to learn more), however, CBD may be worth adding to a daily routine for those frustrated with traditional treatment options. In the meantime, much research is underway, and many studies about CBD's effects on the human body have already been published. The hope is for CBD oil and other cannabis-derived products to help with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or arthritis Many athletes use topical CBD products , either oil or cream, for joint pain.</p>

Interestingly, the endocannabinoid system, something most people wouldn't have heard about until recently, was discovered through various research and studies on the effects of cannabis on the body and was hence named after the plant itself. One of the health effects of cannabis oil includes the ease of pain symptoms from multiple sclerosis. A quarter of a century later, in 1996, the state of California legalized the use of cannabis for treatment of certain medical conditions, despite the federal ban.</p>

Our CBD products may promote relaxation and a calming effect. In a recent study, patients who were undergoing chemotherapy used CBD oil and found it helped to reduce the side effects of chemo, particularly feelings of nausea.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol has been shortened to CBD simply because it's customary for cannabinoids to have a three-letter designation, such as THC for tetrahydrocannabinol, CBG for cannabigerol, CBN for cannabinol and so forth. Research shows that dogs using CBD oil for osteoarthritis were more active and had less pain. Not all CBD products are created equal and not all CBD stores are trustworthy. As with any alternative remedy, medicine, supplement, or treatment, it's very important to understand the potential risks of taking CBD oil.</p>
<p>Szaflarski JP, Bebin EM, Cutter G, DeWolfe J, et al. Cannabidiol improves frequency and severity of seizures and reduces adverse events in an open-label add-on prospective study. There are many benefits of CBD oil and there are so many different ways to use it. If you see CO2 extraction on the label of CBD oil, it means that there is a pure product.
