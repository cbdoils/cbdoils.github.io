When the Control Substance Act was passed in 1970, cultivation of both hemp and marijuana was banned, making it even hard to research or use CBD extract. Luckily, if the level of CBD is high enough, the psychoactive side effects of THC are counteracted. However, scientists believe CBD encourages the body to produce more endocannabinoids. The hemp the brand uses was specifically bred to have high CBD and really low THC. All of our CBD products are guaranteed to contain 0% THC, and each and every product that leaves the facility is third-party tested to ensure consistency and quality.</p>

Scientists who sought to study the various therapeutic effects of marijuana first encountered the endocannabinoid system in the 1990s, and the discovery was a significant breakthrough for medical science. But since the SUNY ophthalmologists did not analyze the CBD oil—and offered up theoretical adulterants as a cause, apparently without knowing whether they were in the CBD product or not—they have no idea, really, what this patient consumed, and it seems sort of intellectually reckless to pin the death on CBD,” Grinspoon said.</p>
