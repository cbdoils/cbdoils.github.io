Not only can CBD reduce cancer-related symptoms, but it can also reduce negative side effects of cancer treatment such as pain, vomiting and nausea.</p>
<p>While marijuana has been used to treat pain for centuries, CBD introduces a new way to achieve the same result.

<p>The first - and more well-known compound - THC is responsible for that ‘high' feeling in addition to some inflammation and pain relief properties. Depression and anxiety can have catastrophic impacts on your well-being and health and even though these disorders are usually treated with pharmaceutical drugs, they often cause many side effects such as headaches, insomnia, agitation, and drowsiness.
