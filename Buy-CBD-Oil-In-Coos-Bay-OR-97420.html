<p>However, there's no guarantee these products will be of good quality. When combined with THC, CBD may actually minimize the psychotropic effects of THC by inhibiting the THC from binding to cannabis receptors. Before we talk about the benefits of CBD massage oil, let's first explain what a CBD massage is. CBD stands for Cannabidiol which is the cannabinoid in cannabis.

<p>However, the difference in how they affect your brain owes to the fact that atoms are arranged differently in CBD and THC. It's now very important to look for reputable brands to order CBD oil from — and avoid the fly-by-night companies plaguing the industry at the moment.
