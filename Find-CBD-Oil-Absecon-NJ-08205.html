<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Aside from CBD products, it is also used to produce textiles, clothing, fuel, food products, bioplastics, and a range of other materials and goods. However, it's illegal for it to be on general sale in the UK. Medical marijuana contains controlled levels of THC, which is the ingredient from the marijuana plant that causes a so-called 'high'. Most people use CBD oil by ingesting it with the help of a dripper. Cannabis containing 0.3 percent or less of THC is hemp.

CBD hemp oil has been used since ancient times to treat a wide range of ailments. A lot of people have mistakenly purchased products labeled as hemp extracts”, or hemp oils” thinking they were CBD oils — only to find these products were hemp seed oil instead.</p>
<p>While marijuana has been used to treat pain for centuries, CBD introduces a new way to achieve the same result. The THC + CBD combination produced a significant reduction in pain while THC alone did not ( R ). The patients in this study suffered from pain not relieved by opioids which is yet another vote of confidence in my opinion for the importance of furthering research on CBD. 2.
