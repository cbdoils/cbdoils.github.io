<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. Taken together, the main revelations of this study suggest transdermal CBD might help alleviate pain from arthritis and other conditions. Sign up today to receive special offers and promotions on CBDfx products while staying up to date on the latest CBD news. Summary Though more human studies are needed, CBD may benefit heart health in several ways, including by reducing blood pressure and preventing heart damage. That said, let's look into some of the most prominent therapeutic CBD oil benefits which are conclusively backed by scientific studies or are in the process of preliminary clinical research.</p>
<p>The murkiness of federal CBD law, and the patchwork of state rules, make selling products with the compound perilous, said Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, an industry group. While recreational cannabis use remains illegal in the U.K., CBD products with low THC content (below 0.2%) have been deemed safe for legal consumption (as it is non-psychoactive). While not definitive, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the self-medication theory of cannabis use in ADHD and the need for further studies of the endocannabinoid system in ADHD.</p>
<h2>Hemp Oil: A Super Food in Colfax?</h2>
<p>CBD and THC act as external stimulants that have similar effects on this very powerful body system, causing different kinds of reactions on different parts of the body. THC is the psychoactive part of cannabis and marijuana that gives that "high" associated with those products. However, further research is needed to determine CBD's other benefits and safety. No. Unlike marijuana or other cannabis products, THC doesn't have the psychoactive cannabinoid associated with the high” feeling most people are familiar with.</p>
<p>Brands can only sell their products as a food supplement, and must not make medical claims. However, many consumers may be unaware of the actual cannabinoid content of their CBD oil. The updated 2018 Farm Bill will remove hemp from the DEA's list of controlled substances which will also increase the exposure of potential medical CBD benefits. CBD oil consists of a high-CBD cannabis extract in a carrier oil base, such as coconut-derived MCT oil. Some people in warmer and more humid climates tend to store their CBD oil in their refrigerator.</p>

Back in 2011, a study published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology found that when people with generalised social anxiety disorder (SAD) were given 600mg of CBD oil prior to a public speaking test, as opposed to a placebo, they experienced significantly less anxiety, difficulty and discomfort during their speech.</p>
