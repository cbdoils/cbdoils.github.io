If you are searching for CBD products with higher concentrations of cannabinoids, our cannabis-based extracts provide the perfect solution. Rest assured, our CBD oil capsules and tinctures do not contain any THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) so they will not get you high, and it is completely legal.

CBD oil is made by extracting CBD from the cannabis or hemp plants and then mixing it with a carrier such as MCT oil. Because it has a high cannabidiol (CBD) content, most CBD products are derived from this plant.</p>

In fact, the human body possesses an endocannabinoid system which works with the natural cannabinoid receptors in the brain and immune system to reduce pain, inflammation, and other things which jeopardize your internal homeostasis. The legal status of CBD products depends on psychotropic substances content. The main difference is that marijuana-derived CBD oils often contain high quantities of THC.

CBD sellers are popping up everywhere, some with product labels that are misleading and, at times, illegal.

<p>Companies that market CBD oil make a wide variety of claims about it. However, scientists and doctors emphasize that the research on CBD is limited, and has been slowed in the United States by federal restrictions. The studies provide proof of principle” that CBD and possibly CBD-THC combinations are valid candidates for novel AD therapies. Less potent than cannabis (from which it's derived), but more potent than hemp (also derived from weed), the specific benefits of CBD are much less well-known than the ingredients itself.</p>
