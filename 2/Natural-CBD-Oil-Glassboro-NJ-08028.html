<p>Whereas, many people have found CBD oil helpful in reducing hallucinations, minus the side effects. Every product that is masked” in a dropper bottle under the name hemp oil extract”, oral hemp extract” or anything similar most probably isn't real CBD oil. Most trials that have been published have used either marijuana, a combination of CBD and THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), or only involved animals. As a matter of fact, there have been experiments to aid in helping people with multiple sclerosis while using a topical form of CBD , such that it does not need to enter the body's digestive system.</p>
