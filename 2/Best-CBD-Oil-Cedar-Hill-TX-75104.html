<p>Let's start by explaining what CBD oil is. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a cannabinoid, a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants.

It's one of the many active cannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa plant. However, within the past decade, they have become increasingly interested in the therapeutic benefits of the other compounds found in both varieties, especially cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
