<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. They claim that they make no distinction between CBD derived from marijuana and CBD derived from hemp, and since the state has set up no regulations under the 2018 Agricultural Act regarding hemp, even CBD derived from hemp is illegal unless it's purchased from a licensed medical cannabis dispensary. Scientists have identified over 113 different cannabinoids in cannabis sativa, and each interacts with the endocannabinoid system in a slightly different way, offering potential therapeutic benefits. CBD hemp oil comes in seemingly endless forms, each with a different concentration of CBD and other phytocannabinoids.</p>

Our quality department has processes in place to verify the concentration and quality of our CBD products.

Because CBD oil is extracted from cannabis plants, a common misconception is that it will elicit a euphoric effect.</p>

However, the effects of CBD vape products are shorter-lived than ingested products, meaning you will have to vape more frequently compared to other methods. CBD oils use cannabidiol as base or carrier oil while the tinctures have an alcohol base.</p>
<p>With that being said, for CBD oil to change people's lives and reach its optimum potential, a lot more work has to be done by legislators, CBD marketers, and other stakeholders. While many people use cannabidiol to relieve pain, more scientific research is needed to be sure it is safe.

<p>CBD is extracted from cannabis flowers or cannabis leaves and processed into edible oil. Some consumers prefer CBD products that contain at least small amounts of THC.

While none of this pollen should make it into your CBD oil, and very few people are allergic to marijuana pollen, you should still be careful the very first time using CBD oil and use as tiny an amount as possible. As research into cannabis- and hemp-derived CBD expands, doctors and healthcare providers will have a better understanding of how CBD works and who might benefit most from it.</p>
<p>In the study, 24 smokers were recruited and split into two groups; one group received inhalers containing CBD oil and the other one received inhalers containing a placebo.
