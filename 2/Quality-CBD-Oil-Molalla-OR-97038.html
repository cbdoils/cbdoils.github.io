<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. By massaging CBD products onto sore muscles, joints, and damaged skin, you can focus the CBD oil effects on target areas instead of distributing the cannabinoids throughout your body via your bloodstream.
