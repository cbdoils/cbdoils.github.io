<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. In the US, CBD must also be derived exclusively from hemp, but the THC limit is 0.3% THC. Anxiety: A much-cited 2011 study published in Neuropsychopharmacology found that pretreatment with CBD significantly reduced anxiety before a public speaking engagement. Love CBD oil was developed because most of the CBD oils being sold on the market were being made from industrial hemp waste. Most CBD oils are just that … the beneficial CBD without the THC. A prescription-only nasal spray product (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) containing both 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol has been shown to be effective for improving pain, muscle-tightness, and urination frequency in people with MS. This product is used in over 25 countries outside of the United States.</p>
