<p>People often get them through their diet by eating foods rich in fatty acids, such as fish, nuts, and plant oils.

As for anti-aging beauty products (yes, there are anti-aging CBD products) such as serums, creams, cleansers-you name it-the jury's out. Because the compound is associated with a variety of health benefits but lacks mind-altering effects, it is being marketed as treatment for insomnia and other sleep disorders, in addition to issues like anxiety, epilepsy, and pain.</p>

<p>Furthermore, many test-tube and animal subject studies have show that CBD can indeed help not only prevent death of cardiovascular cells but also reduce inflammation which is often associated with heart disease. It does not change a person's state of mind when they use it. However, it may produce significant changes in the body, and it is showing some significant medical benefits. Finally, CBD oil may help manage the side effects of cancer treatments. What we know about CBD oil for depression is that there are some benefits over antidepressant medications, and this is because of the way in which CBD works with receptors in our central and peripheral nervous systems, known as CB1 and CB2.</p>
