<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary.

CBD can be extracted from a cannabis plant, but it doesn't have the same ability to create a high” or state of euphoria as marijuana or THC.
