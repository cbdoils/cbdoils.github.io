<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN).

Hemp-derived CBD oil by law contains less than 0.3% THC and is available throughout most states. Oils can also be extracted from marijuana the same way they can be extracted from hemp. Chronic pain, sleep loss, anxiety, and nausea are prevalent complaints among American adults, many of whom work long hours and struggle to prioritize their health.</p>
