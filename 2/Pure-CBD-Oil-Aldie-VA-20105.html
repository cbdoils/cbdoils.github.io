<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can find more information about the CBD content of our CBD oil range by checking the Information” tab for each product. Full-spectrum CBD oil benefits include longer and more intense effects. 2. Full-spectrum vs. CBD Isolate: Remember, for CBD oil to be legal in the U.S., it must contain less than 0.3% THC. Now, the good thing about CBD oil is that it doesn't really possess serious side effects. Here are seven health benefits of CBD oil that are backed by scientific evidence. If you are new to CBD products, CBD oil is a great way to get started.</p>
<p>By augmenting the body's own cannabinoids, CBD and the other trace cannabinoids found in hemp oil are able to stimulate the endocannabinoid system to encourage balance and optimal functioning. However, when used in moderate amounts, most people do not experience these side effects, and none of them are known for being fatal or particularly dangerous. Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>

<p>Marijuana-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess, and consume for adults 21 and over and approved minors. CBD derived from marijuana and hemp is touted as having many health-promoting benefits. Since CBD provides robust pain relief options, it is possible to use it as a treatment strategy. In a study (4) , published in the International Journal of Neuroscience in 2009, such patients when treated with oral doses of 100-600mg CBD oil per day for a period of 6 weeks, alongside standard medications, showed signs of improvement.</p>
<p>For a product to legally be considered hemp oil, there must be less than 0.3% THC in the CBD products. Since CBD oil includes the full spectrum of cannabinoids, it can produce what experts call an entourage effect ,” where multiple compounds work together to create more intense and possibly more beneficial effects than each compound could have individually. CBD products are not well regulated, so there can be inconsistencies in how much CBD is in a product. CBD, though, does not contain the chemical in marijuana that makes people high.</p>
