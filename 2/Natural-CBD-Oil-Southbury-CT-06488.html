<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. They claim that they make no distinction between CBD derived from marijuana and CBD derived from hemp, and since the state has set up no regulations under the 2018 Agricultural Act regarding hemp, even CBD derived from hemp is illegal unless it's purchased from a licensed medical cannabis dispensary. Scientists have identified over 113 different cannabinoids in cannabis sativa, and each interacts with the endocannabinoid system in a slightly different way, offering potential therapeutic benefits. CBD hemp oil comes in seemingly endless forms, each with a different concentration of CBD and other phytocannabinoids.</p>
<p>CBD is legal in the UK as long as it's THC content doesn't exceed 0.2%. Because of this, most CBD products in the UK are made from hemp as it is naturally low in THC and high in CBD. In addition, THC was found in 18 products. However, certain states (even some non-medical ones) have passed laws permitting the case-by-case use of CBD oil and other low-THC CBD products. Although these initial results look promising, scientists need to carry out studies in humans to confirm the benefits of this oil. These oils can often be confused with hemp-derived CBD oil, when in fact, the two are quite different from one another.</p>

In the meantime, much research is underway, and many studies about CBD's effects on the human body have already been published.
