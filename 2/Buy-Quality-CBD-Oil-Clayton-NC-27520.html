<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. CBD has been shown, through small studies, to aid in reducing social anxiety disorder. Since July, all hemp-derived CBD products sold in stores in Indiana must include a QR code on their label that lets consumers download a product's COA to their phone. These effects make cannabidiol able to diminish the burning, prickling and tingling sensations often associated with neuropathic or nerve related pain as well as pain related to inflammation. In CBD sublingual oil, the hemp oil is combined with MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oil that's derived from coconuts.</p>
<p>A small 2010 study found that cannabidiol could reduce symptoms of social anxiety in people with social anxiety disorder (SAD).

CBD's anti-anxiety effect is why many in the cannabis community talk about how CBD relieves paranoia, although that is not scientifically proven yet. One of the most celebrated health benefits of CBD oil is its analgesic (pain relieving) effects. Of course, price will always be a determining factor in the CBD products you choose to use.</p>
