<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. Their CBD products were created with the Hawaiian Islands as their inspiration, and they deliver a special kind of mellow. Another cause for concern is the unreliability of the purity and dosage of CBD in products. Improving Heart Health—research has found that CBD oil not only reduced blood pressure but somewhat regulated it. Avoid companies that claim their products have disease benefits. Hemp, on the other hand, only has a tiny amount of naturally-occurring THC and can be sold when the hemp oil has less than 0.3% THC.</p>
<p>The same 0.3 percent THC level restriction is used for CBD oil, too. Very thoughtful on part of the writer to describe the real image of the CBD products. Unlike other cannabinoids — such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — CBD does not produce a euphoric high” or psychoactive effect.
