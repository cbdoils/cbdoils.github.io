<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits. Additionally, several animal studies have demonstrated that CBD may help reduce the inflammation and cell death associated with heart disease due to its powerful antioxidant and stress-reducing properties. For a CBD product to be considered as a legal hemp product, it needs to have no more than 0.3% THC.</p>

<h2>What Really Is CBD and How Does It Work in Clinton?</h2>
<p>The cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa) includes two variations of the same species—hemp and marijuana. Marijuana-derived CBD oils will generally contain a high level of THC and, for that reason, are illegal on the federal level. It retains all the other cannabinoids, even THC, to give you more potent health benefits. Made from pure hemp oil extracts, they are potent and powerful, and you can order CBD oil in our online store. When one chooses to buy CBD oil for pain, the recommendation is to look for the best CBD oil.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol can only be included in "cosmetic" products and only if it contains less than 0.3% THC. That's why all of our products are made using locally-grown hemp, extracted using eco-friendly solvent free CO2, and free from harmful chemical byproducts. CO2 extraction doesn't require additional solvents, which helps to keep the CBD oils clean and pure. Our Virgin cannabis sativa hemp oil is a hemp seed oil, and our Premium hemp oil products, have hemp oil from the stem of the plant (which is listed in milligrams on the bottle) It also has hemp seed oil in the bottle to act as a carrier oil.</p>

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>
<p>Other studies show that CBD lessened the physical signs of anxiety, which include sweaty palms, dizziness, racing heart, and chest pain. Both of these substances are indeed part of the plant, they interact with cannabinoid receptors which can be found in your body and in your brain, but their effects are widely different. Simply Pure offers affordable broad-spectrum CBD oils tested for purity and potency with a third-party lab so that you know you are buying something safe and effective. Since CBD oil is derived from hemp, you may wonder if CBD oil and hemp oil are the same things.</p>
<p>CBD hemp oil is different from hemp oil found in most grocery and health food markets , which are likely created using hemp seed oil and contain only trace amounts of CBD. As you begin to explore the interesting world of CBD, you may be shocked to discover that there is a large variety of types, companies , and potencies of products available and it can be quite overwhelming to someone looking into buying CBD oil. It's just a matter of time before CBD products are regulated by the FDA. The best thing you can do is get some research under your belt, and see what kind of CBD products and companies are out there.</p>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of CBD oil, explore our products and experience the benefits for yourself. Far-reaching medical claims tout its success at treating various conditions such as anxiety, acne, insomnia, addiction, inflammation, and Parkinson's disease. Our best results came from taking both the CBD oil under the tongue while at the same time applying the CBD cream (or more potent salve, or lotion ) directly to the joints in pain. However, certain states have only legalized CBD for medical use, and that requires special licensing.</p>
