Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids.
