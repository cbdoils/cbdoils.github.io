One way in which CBD products may dampen pain is by inhibiting the release of inflammatory agents like glutamate. CBD oil has no or negligible traces of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol - another compound found in the plant), which is indeed a psychoactive cannabinoid and is responsible for the famous marijuana high.</p>
<p>Due to controversies surrounding the cannabis plant, industrial-grade CBD is extracted from hemp (another plant that falls under the Cannabis Sativa species), as it has less than 0.3% THC.

One of the most crucial steps in producing CBD oil is isolating the relevant cannabinoids and terpenes via CO₂ extraction. This being the case, there are a lot of companies taking advantage of the CBD oil demand thus are making products that don't contain enough or any CBD at all. Meanwhile, hemp seed oil (sometimes called just hemp oil) is made from only the seeds of the hemp plant and contains minuscule (if any) quantities of CBD.</p>
