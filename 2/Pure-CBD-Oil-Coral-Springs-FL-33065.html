Our ultimate goal is to create CBD wellness products that we would not only take ourselves but also be proud to share with our friends and family. But there are still products labeled as dietary supplements on the market that contain cannabidiol. CV Sciences products are sold in more than 1,500 health food stores nationally, including Campbell's Nutrition in Des Moines and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in West Des Moines. CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a natural active compound found in Cannabis plants. Incidentally, no cases of toxicity or overdose from the use of hemp-based (industrial-grade hemp) CBD oil have been reported so far.</p>
<p>Hemp-derived CBD is legal federally. Even though recreational pot is far from legal on a national scale, the use of medical marijuana is currently permitted in 30 of America's 50 states This might be why the majority of our respondents had already heard whispers about marijuana's non-psychoactive derivative, CBD-a substance oft-used as an alternative treatment for common ailments including pain, depression, and anxiety. Also, depending on the amount used and route of administration, these products have the potential to produce impairing drug effects.</p>

Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine. While there's a lot of tongue-wagging around cannabis-related products, there is a burgeoning awareness about the potential medical benefits of CBD oil.</p>
