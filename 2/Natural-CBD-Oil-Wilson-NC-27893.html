<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. When you use a phytocannabinoid, you supplement the bodies natural endocannabinoids to increase the ability (the gain) of the endocannabinoid system to orchestrate (think orchestra conductor) the various receptors and systems needed to bring the body back into a healthy working balance.

Another study carried out a couple of years later confirmed that CBD has the potential of relieving inflammation and pain linked to arthritis when applied topically.</p>
