CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>
