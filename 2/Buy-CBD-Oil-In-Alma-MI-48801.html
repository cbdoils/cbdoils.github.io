<p>Dry Mouth: As is the case with many other hemp- and marijuana-based products, CBD oil often leads to a condition known as dry mouth (or cottonmouth). Unlike Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis which causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana, CBD is not psychoactive. According to CBDKyro , the most common side effects and risk of CBD oil include tiredness, diarrhea, change in appetite, tendency to get irritable, nausea and fatigue.</p>
<p>However, take into consideration that, as with any other remedy or medicine, preexisting conditions can exacerbate, or simply nullify CBD benefits. There is some thought that those rare few who do experience increased anxiety when taking CBD may be having an allergic reaction to something in the CBD, so it's best if you have a history of having histamine reactions or allergies to take a form of CBD that has the fewest added ingredients and a carrier oil that is not going to trigger your allergies. However, Before you begin to supplement your efforts with CBD oil, consult your physician.</p>
