<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>
<p>Because the CBD industry isn't well regulated, there are a lot of poor quality products on the market. Penguin CBD sources its hemp from Oregon, which enforces high-quality growing standards to decrease the likelihood of cannabis plants absorbing any harmful substances. Have you ever opened up Google and typed in where to buy CBD oil near me?” Or maybe you just went with the super obvious search term and punched in CBD oil near me.” Either way, if you're wanting to know what the best options are for finding the highest-quality CBD products - no matter where you live - then this post is for you.</p>

CBD may be a powerful treatment for a variety of forms of anxiety, including social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
