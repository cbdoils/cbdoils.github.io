<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. Scientists have identified over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids. There are literally hundreds of CBD companies selling CBD online that will ship directly to your door — many of which don't even charge for shipping.</p>
<p>Hemp-derived CBD is legal federally. Even though recreational pot is far from legal on a national scale, the use of medical marijuana is currently permitted in 30 of America's 50 states This might be why the majority of our respondents had already heard whispers about marijuana's non-psychoactive derivative, CBD-a substance oft-used as an alternative treatment for common ailments including pain, depression, and anxiety. Also, depending on the amount used and route of administration, these products have the potential to produce impairing drug effects.</p>

And, of course, as it stands, there are no regulations in place to assure the quality of products sold through websites.</p>
<p>Note that THC and CBD are stored in the body's fat and can show up on drug tests for weeks after you use them.
