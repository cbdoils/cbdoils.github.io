CBD oil offers many potential benefits and can be taken in a variety of ways. Although clinical trials on humans ascertaining the effectiveness of CBD oil for depression are rare, animal model studies, such as these ones from 2014 , 2018 , and 2019 , indicate that it could have similar success as the use of CBD for anxiety has.
