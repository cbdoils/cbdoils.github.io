<p>On top of the added medical benefits of THC, CBD oil derived from marijuana, not hemp, has been shown to be of better quality and likely have a slower rate of increased tolerance. Relevant research has shown that CBD oil side effects do exist, even though they are rare. CBD-based products can be taken orally, applied to the skin or inhaled. Additionally, animal studies have been conducted to find that CBD may be a potential treatment for arthritis , and one report concluded that "there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults."

But before we move on to our list of 10 best CBD oils for pain, let's shed light on the analgesic mechanism of this cannabinoid.</p>
