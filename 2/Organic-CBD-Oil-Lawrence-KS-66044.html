<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , there are currently 10 states that have legalized recreational and medical marijuana THC and CBD use. The easiest and most convenient way to buy CBD products is online — and you don't have to worry about the Drug Enforcement Administration breaking down your door, despite the ambiguity surrounding CBD's legality. The frustration of this simple-yet-ongoing issue is compounded by the fact that, as a form of medicinal treatment, marijuana-derived CBD oil holds the potential to help so many millions of individuals.</p>
<p>Fat conversion: Some studies suggest that CBD helps convert bad (white) fat into favorable (brown) fat that is easy for the body to zap.

<p>Cannabidiol and THC are just two of the plant's more than 100 cannabinoids. This is a real concern in the industry—take the 2017 Journal of the American Medical Association study, for example, which tested 84 CBD products and found that 26% contained lower doses than stated on the bottle. Several studies have shown that CBD oil has a high potential for treating skin conditions, like eczema, by encouraging abnormal cell death. A 2016 study conducted on a rat model of arthritis reported that CBD gel was effective in reducing the pain and swelling in the rats' joints.</p>
<p>Much of this research is still in the early phases (with a lot of room to learn more), however, CBD may be worth adding to a daily routine for those frustrated with traditional treatment options. In the meantime, much research is underway, and many studies about CBD's effects on the human body have already been published. The hope is for CBD oil and other cannabis-derived products to help with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or arthritis Many athletes use topical CBD products , either oil or cream, for joint pain.</p>

Hemp oil extract, which contains less than 0.3 percent of the compound THC, is legal in all 50 states.</p>
