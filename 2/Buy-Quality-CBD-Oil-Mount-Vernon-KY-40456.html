<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. While CBD oil is made from the leaves or buds of a cannabis plant, hempseed oil is made by pressing oil from hempseed,” says Kyle, who likened it to how olive oil is made by pressing whole olives. Both hemp and marijuana have dozens of other beneficial phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol. Because the FDA doesn't regulate CBD, it is possible to buy a product that is more or less potent than advertised, or even contains small amounts of THC. Hemp seeds make an effective way to grow hemp crops that will eventually produce CBD, but you have to really know how to plant the seeds.</p>
<p>Consumers love that they can get all hemp CBD benefits in the tastiest way possible.

You may have noticed three distinct letters on a lot of products lately: CBD. Obviously, CBD oil is different from hemp oil. However, these side effects have been found to be mild according to various studies. Unlike THC (the active cannabinoid in marijuana), CBD is not intoxicating which means it will not get you high.</p>

Touted for a variety of health benefits, CBD is flooding the marketplace in the form of topicals, edibles, tinctures, and vape oils. Naturally-occurring plant-derived cannabinoids like CBD share a similar molecular structure to the cannabinoids that your own body synthesizes.</p>

The pet industry just recently entered the fray , and promises to become one of the biggest consumers of CBD products.

Any CBD products that you can find online will be made exclusively from industrial hemp, and will contain only trace amounts of THC.</p>
