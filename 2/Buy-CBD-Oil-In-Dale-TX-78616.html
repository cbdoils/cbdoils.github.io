<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. The resulting product has a higher concentration of CBD than the raw extract, hence the term CBD-rich oil. They source their organic hemp from Colorado and they submit their products to third-party labs to test their purity and safety.

<p>CBD oil products mimic the naturally oily plant material they're extracted from. Research shows that CBD injections reduce the pain of surgical incision in rats and that it also reduces inflammation and nerve pain. In another 2014 study , 22 people with Parkinson's Disease who received CBD-rich cannabis saw significant improvement in pain, tremors, sleep, and mobility. Because we understand how hard it is to find high-quality and safe CBD oils near your area, we did the hard work of doing the research for you.</p>
