<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Aside from CBD products, it is also used to produce textiles, clothing, fuel, food products, bioplastics, and a range of other materials and goods.

As for anti-aging beauty products (yes, there are anti-aging CBD products) such as serums, creams, cleansers-you name it-the jury's out. Because the compound is associated with a variety of health benefits but lacks mind-altering effects, it is being marketed as treatment for insomnia and other sleep disorders, in addition to issues like anxiety, epilepsy, and pain.</p>
<p>Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common side effect for people who take relatively large doses of CBD oil, and is linked to the substance interacting with the digestive system.

<p>CBD oil concentrate is all-natural hemp oil extracted from the stalk of non-GMO hemp plants, tested for quality, and packaged for sale in an easy-to-use oral applicator with no additives. CBD percentages: Watch out for products advertising whole plant extract percentages of CBD, as opposed to the level of CBD in mgs in the product. However, many companies only offer CBD oil in low to moderate potencies. While previously hemp was only legal to grow for hemp pilot programs and research needs, the passage of the 2018 bill reclassified hemp as an agricultural commodity and made it legal to produce all hemp-derived products, including CBD oil.</p>
