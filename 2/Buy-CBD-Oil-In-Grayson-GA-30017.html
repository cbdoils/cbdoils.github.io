<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. The real miracle of plant-based cannabinoids - like CBD - is how precisely they mimic and interact with the bodies own endocannabinoids and receptor system. Cannabis is a family of plants with two primary classifications - Indica and Sativa, however these classifications are under debate. If you want a broad range of cannabinoids and other hemp compounds, go with our broad-spectrum oil. When the essential oils of the hemp plant are first extracted, the resulting product is considered raw hemp extract. Before testing the Bota Hemp CBD oil, we unanimously decided to take a one-week break from all CBD products.</p>
<p>For most children, the health benefits of outweigh the side effects. Some people turn to hemp Oil because of the flavor, and that makes a difference. While hemp oil does contain trace amounts of THC, the levels are about 100 times lower than the federal limit of 0.3%. Most drug screens are targeting delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and don't detect constituents of other hemp-based cannabidiols. For the highest concentration of CBD, products like our flagship brand Real Scientific Hemp Oil (RSHO) pure CBD hemp oil gives you up to 190 mg of CBD per serving.</p>
