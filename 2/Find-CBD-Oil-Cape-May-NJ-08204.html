<meta name="description" content="CBD Oil in Cape May New Jersey - If true, the news that a cannabis product killed someone would amount to the upending of a longstanding claim from weed legalization advocates that the drug is so safe no one has ever died from it.

<p>If you want to take back your health, well-being, and energy by using a quick-acting, natural, plant-based remedy with almost zero side effects, all with the minimum possible investment, you NEED to look into these amazingly therapeutic CBD oil benefits.

Rather, in addition to its medical marijuana program, they have a bill (H.B. 967) that allows qualified farmers and certain individuals to legally grow industrial hemp for research purposes (industrial hemp of course being the raw material that most legal” CBD oils are sourced from). That document shows how a product performed on tests checking for CBD and THC levels, and the presence of contaminants.</p>
<p>Unlike THC, the main constituent in cannabis, cannabidiol will not induce intoxicating effects.
