<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. While the scientific jury may still be out on some of the benefits of CBD oil, people are still using it and finding relief. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Most CBD oil and treats for dogs comes from hemp oil , so it contains no or very small traces of THC.

So, per section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 , hemp is defined as having less than 0.3% THC, and therefore by default CANNABIS has more than 0.3% THC.

<p>CBD oil is widely regarded as an effective product to treat and manage pain. If you inquire about Purchase CBD oil online in Google, you will see a million offers with prices varied from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds.
