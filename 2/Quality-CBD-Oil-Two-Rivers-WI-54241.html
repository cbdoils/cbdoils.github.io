<p>The best CBD oils on the market are those that will help you manage your health, change the way that you address your health problems, and will make you feel like a functional human being during the day. In locations where recreational marijuana is legal, consumers can enjoy CBD oil and products that contain some percentage of THC if they want a mild high without some of the negative effects of THC. A study using Sativex, an oral spray that combines CBD and THC, has proven very effective, reducing spasms in 75% of the 276 people with MS who were resistant to regular medication. Even the staff at Merry Jane have taken note of Penguin CBD, with a positive first-hand review of their products. This is also because of the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD that will soothe the skin and reduce the pain of some skin conditions as well.</p>
