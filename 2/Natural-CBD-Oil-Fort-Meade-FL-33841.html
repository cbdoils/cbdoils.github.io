<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket. Each of these uses our high quality hemp extract, with 0% THC. Some manufacturers are advertising CBD products with unproven medical claims, and the quality and safety of these products can vary.</p>
<p>Pure CBD oil is derived from the hemp plant, extracted with supercritical CO2 and then refined. However, it must be the high-quality CBD that has been sourced from organic plants and extracted to deliver pure and potent oil. CBDPure oils are made with non-GMO hemp, grown in Colorado by local farmers. However, our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical conditions.
