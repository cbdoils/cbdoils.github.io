<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. While the scientific jury may still be out on some of the benefits of CBD oil, people are still using it and finding relief. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Most CBD oil and treats for dogs comes from hemp oil , so it contains no or very small traces of THC. Although ingesting CBD offers the most benefits, the body can absorb CBD through the skin. With over 9,000 verified customer reviews on our products, we hope that everyday people sharing their personal stories and experiences can help guide and inform you before you purchase CBD oil.</p>
<p>Raw CBD oil can be green or dark in color because it often contains phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and raw plant material. However, it's a grab bag of quality because the company can't divulge all of the necessary information in its listing. In our FAQ you can learn all about the CBD oil benefits. This quality makes CBD an appealing option for those who are looking for relief from pain and other symptoms without the mind-altering effects of marijuana or other pharmaceutical drugs. When you are purchasing CBD products, go through a company that has its own store.</p>

<p>Legal Disclaimer: The Good Earth Global Ltd or affiliates do not sell, distribute, or manufacture any products that are in violation of the United States Controlled Substances Act (). Legal in the USA - CBD is legal in the United States when contained within hemp oil under the 2014 Farm Bill. Manufacturers use solvents such as hexane, ethanol, ether, or methanol to get the medicinal oils out of the plant material. Even though the animal studies and clinical trials that exist today highlight the potential benefits of medical marijuana and CBD oil, they still don't conclude anything.</p>
