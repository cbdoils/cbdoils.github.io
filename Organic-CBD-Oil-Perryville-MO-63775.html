<h2>What Is CBD Oil in Perryville?</h2>
<p>The plant Cannabis sativa has two primary species, hemp and marijuana. Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, impacts the brain without a high, and tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC, has pain-relieving properties. The plant is cold processed in high quality extra virgin hemp seed oil. Overall, CBD oil is extracted from the flowers of the hemp plant, instead of the leaves or seeds. One study found that a single dose of cannabidiol helped to reduce blood pressure in healthy patients. On the other hand, CBD oil is made with extracts from the flowers, leaves, and stalks of cannabis Sativa, which are rich in CBD and other cannabinoids.</p>
<p>THC is the compound that causes a high and all Green Roads products have less than the federally legal limit of 0.3% THC. THC is also available in many store-bought products such as brownies and candy, but only in places where cannabis consumption has been legalised - this is because consuming these products is equivalent to smoking cannabis and will result in psychoactive effects. In 2014, a rodent study showed that CBD might help people retain the ability to recognize familiar faces. That's not enough to get you high, and some companies remove even those trace amounts of CBD from their oil.</p>
