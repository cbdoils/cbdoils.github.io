<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>
<p>Pure CBD oil is derived from the hemp plant, extracted with supercritical CO2 and then refined. However, it must be the high-quality CBD that has been sourced from organic plants and extracted to deliver pure and potent oil. CBDPure oils are made with non-GMO hemp, grown in Colorado by local farmers. However, our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical conditions. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your healthcare provider or 911 immediately. According to a study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse , CBD oil is shown to reduce stress in animals like rats.</p>

To help consumers differentiate between high quality CBD Oil and inferior products, Veré starts with transparency. When preparing to take a liquid form, be aware that the CBD extract is mixed with a carrier oil, so there are two measures to know: the amount of the liquid product to take (the dose) and the amount of CBD in each dose. CBD oil affects the body by interacting with built-in receptors that are already present within us.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol can only be included in "cosmetic" products and only if it contains less than 0.3% THC. That's why all of our products are made using locally-grown hemp, extracted using eco-friendly solvent free CO2, and free from harmful chemical byproducts. CO2 extraction doesn't require additional solvents, which helps to keep the CBD oils clean and pure. Our Virgin cannabis sativa hemp oil is a hemp seed oil, and our Premium hemp oil products, have hemp oil from the stem of the plant (which is listed in milligrams on the bottle) It also has hemp seed oil in the bottle to act as a carrier oil.</p>
