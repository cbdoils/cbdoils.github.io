<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. CBD oil offers many potential benefits and can be taken in a variety of ways. Although clinical trials on humans ascertaining the effectiveness of CBD oil for depression are rare, animal model studies, such as these ones from 2014 , 2018 , and 2019 , indicate that it could have similar success as the use of CBD for anxiety has. To be sure that you're getting a product that is legal across all 50 states, you need to double-check that your CBD extracts are made using hemp and contain less than 0.3% THC. For example, a product known as polyethylene glycol is often used in CBD vape oils.</p>
<p>In a study into the effects of CBD in people with Parkinson's disease and psychosis, six participants showed significant improvement in symptoms with a dosage of 150 mg per day of CBD. If the answer is yes, then full spectrum CBD oils may not be a feasible option due to their THC content; although these oils contain trace amounts of THC, this may lead to a failed drug test.

<p>With the rising popularity of CBD oil for dogs, there's a plethora of companies selling cannabis products. Take note, however, that some CBD oils may contain trace amounts of THC. Phrases such as Hemp-derived, Full spectrum, Pure cannabidiol, and Certified CBD must be mentioned in the label. CBD oil comes from the buds, flowers, and leaves of the plant. Unfortunately, most commercially available hemp oil products are not only costly, but they have poor absorption or low ‘bioavailability' (typically 6-10% absorption).</p>

<p>Both are designed to NOT get you high as CBD is only legal when it contains less than 0.3% THC. The drug marijuana, which is also known as weed or pot, is the leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant.
