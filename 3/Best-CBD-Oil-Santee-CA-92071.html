<p>Studies have shown that CBD has the potential to ease symptoms of many conditions, including chronic pain and inflammation. Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of these compounds found in hemp and marijuana plants.

<p>While there are plenty of CBD oils and tinctures on the market today, it's important to know that not all of them are created equal. However, the cardiovascular benefits of using CBD oil do exist. As one clinical trial editor put it , The endogenous cannabinoid system—named for the plant that led to its discovery—is one of the most important physiologic systems involved in establishing and maintaining human health…the endocannabinoids are literally a bridge between body and mind. Topical products may also include common over-the-counter ingredients such as menthol, capsaicin or camphor, making it difficult to determine if a positive effect is due to the CBD or another ingredient.</p>

Every additional stage of processing the CBD hemp extract exposes the cannabinoids and terpenes to damage.
