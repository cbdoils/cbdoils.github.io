<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>
