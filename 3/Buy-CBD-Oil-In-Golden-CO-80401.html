<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. In the US, CBD must also be derived exclusively from hemp, but the THC limit is 0.3% THC.

<h3>Buy Hemp CBD Oil in Golden CO</h3>
<p>Not to be confused with hemp seed oil , CBD oil comes from industrial hemp plants that have been bred to contain trace amounts of THC - the ingredient in the marijuana plant that's associated with a so-called ‘high'.
