In some countries, the allowed THC level on products is shallow. While the CBD oil tinctures are our most popular seller and will often answer the question of where to buy cbd oil”, capsules are a great alternative for those who dislike the mildly bitter taste of hemp oil, which many people describe as earthy” or grassy.” (Capsules are also good for those who have a hard time holding the oil for 60-90 seconds before swallowing). But that's not the only reason CBD hemp is a highly sustainable product. The rest of the samples on the list would be considered Cannabis being that they have THC levels that are higher than 0.3%. Regardless, the amounts of CBD in the samples that come from both Hemp and Cannabis are both pretty high.</p>
