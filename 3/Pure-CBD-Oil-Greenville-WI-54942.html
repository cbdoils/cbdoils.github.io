<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. Again, the answer in most cases is no. This is because most CBD products today are made from hemp, which contains less than 0.3% THC content on a dry weight basis.

<h2>What Really Is CBD and How Does It Work in Greenville?</h2>

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>

<p>As you shop for CBD products, it's also important to understand that CBD oil is not the same as hemp seed oil (which is sometimes labeled hemp oil). One study in Frontiers in Pharmacology, suggested cannabinoids' anti-inflammatory effect may reduce inflammation too much. THC of course is an active component in marijuana that can help with various medical conditions. Cannabidiol may also limit inflammation in the brain and nervous system, which may benefit people experiencing pain, insomnia , and certain immune-system responses.</p>
