<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN). In a 2016 study , Scott Shannon and his fellow researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins demonstrated that CBD oil can be safely and effectively used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders in children with PTSD.</p>
<p>Still, not all companies guarantee that their CBD products come from hemp. CBD oil does not stimulate the appetite in the same way medical marijuana can. This requires patients to obtain a verified medical marijuana card prior to purchasing CBD oil. The vast majority of CBD oils come in bottles measuring either 15 milliliters (mL), or 0.5 ounces; or 30 mL, or 1 ounce. An extensive review conducted in 2014 concluded that CBD might be a viable treatment option for osteoarthritis (OA) pain.

This is why many CBD oil companies can ship to all 50 U.S. states - because their products are hemp-derived.</p>
<p>As part of a comprehensive review by the World Health Organisation (WHO), CBD was found to be "well-tolerated". What many people don't know is that CBD oil can work well on your skin the same way it is useful when taken inside the body. CBD oil is also used to help with depression, migraines, IBS, mental disorders, inflammation, and seizures.
