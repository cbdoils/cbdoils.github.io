If you want a broad range of cannabinoids and other hemp compounds, go with our broad-spectrum oil. When the essential oils of the hemp plant are first extracted, the resulting product is considered raw hemp extract.

CBD is in early clinical trials for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, says Blessing, who is currently studying whether CBD could be used to treat PTSD in people with alcohol use disorder.</p>
