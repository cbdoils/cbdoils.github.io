<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil comes from the bud and flowers of the cannabis plant. A 2017 study found CBD was effective for chronic neuropathy pain. At EvoPure we are working tirelessly towards this goal and as such have been motivated to create some of the purest, most natural and most research-backed CBD products in the world, in the hope of spreading the news to as many people as possible. The quality of the starting hemp is also a major factor in the cost of the oil.
