CBD oil made from hemp is non-intoxicating and will not cause any euphoric effects, but how using CBD oil makes you feel can vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Knowing the source of your CBD oil will help you know its quality. Humans have the endocannabinoid system, or ECS, meaning they naturally respond to the influx of cannabinoids from the cannabis plant. For hemp-derived CBD oil, the product's COA would include information on which cannabinoids, along with compounds like heavy metals, are in the product. It's one of the many active cannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa plant. However, within the past decade, they have become increasingly interested in the therapeutic benefits of the other compounds found in both varieties, especially cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
<p>The addition of hemp seed oil instead of the standard MCT oil as the carrier oil gives this product additional pain-killing benefits.

Some products that might claim to be medical cannabis, such as "CBD oil" or hemp oil, are available to buy legally as food supplements from health stores. Endoca uses a supercritical CO2 extraction process and the quality of the CBD oil is verified by GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certification as well as third party laboratory testing. These products were some of the first ever developed and manufactured by the Active CBD oil brand.</p>
