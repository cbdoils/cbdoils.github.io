<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. The combination of cannabinoids, as opposed to just CBD, can affect multiple targets within the body and enhance the overall effect. Every single day, people hear about CBD oil and how it keeps our bodies running at their best for the first time. CBD can impact the interaction between endocannabinoids and these receptors, thereby potentially providing some pain relief through this process. For example, in one 2010 study , researchers found that using CBD to treat diabetic mice with cardiovascular disease help reduce oxidative stress (which is linked to inflammation) and prevent heart failure.</p>
<p>A small 2010 study found that cannabidiol could reduce symptoms of social anxiety in people with social anxiety disorder (SAD). CBD oil is non-psychoactive and non-intoxicating, which means it can be safely consumed by people of all ages. CBD's anti-anxiety effect is why many in the cannabis community talk about how CBD relieves paranoia, although that is not scientifically proven yet. One of the most celebrated health benefits of CBD oil is its analgesic (pain relieving) effects. Of course, price will always be a determining factor in the CBD products you choose to use.</p>

<p>I can honestly - and sadly - say the only difference I noticed was to my bank balance.' Professor Gino Martini, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Chief Scientist and Professor of Pharmaceutical Innovation at King's College London, says it is important to remember that correctly formulated high-street CBD is of a very low strength; so low that it is classed a food supplement rather than a medicine, meaning it is unlikely that the pharmaceutical industry will ever do clinical trials on it. ‘To be medically effective, the cannabidiol shown in clinical trials - for example, to help children with rare forms of epilepsy - is given at much higher concentrations than what's available for the public to buy,' he says.</p>
