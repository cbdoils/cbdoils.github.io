<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. This Colorado-based company grows their own organic hemp and they offer a CBD oil with just two ingredients. But recent studies have revealed that the benefits of CBD are best realised when it's combined with THC, leaving people who could potentially benefit from treatment at a loss.

<p>But, as mentioned, many brands out there make false claims about their CBD products.

Other studies support the positive effects of CBD oil for arthritis swelling and joint pain.</p>
<p>While marijuana has been used to treat pain for centuries, CBD introduces a new way to achieve the same result. The THC + CBD combination produced a significant reduction in pain while THC alone did not ( R ). The patients in this study suffered from pain not relieved by opioids which is yet another vote of confidence in my opinion for the importance of furthering research on CBD. 2. Hemp oil for cognitive health. There were few cases when real CBD oil could be found on Amazon under a different name, but most definitely, those products are long gone.</p>

<p>CBD isolates are exactly what they sound like — CBD that has been removed from all other cannabinoids and chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant. Ultimately, the quality of any CBD oil comes down to the extraction process that's used and how well the CBD extract is purified. There are currently no over-the-counter (OTC) CBD products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some products may not be as effective or reliable as others. All products are imported and have undergone strict quality controls to ensure purity and potency at all times.</p>
