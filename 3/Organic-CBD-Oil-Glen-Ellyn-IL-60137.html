<p>Any information on AHO tincture, I bought some unknowingly and under the impression of the salesperson that it had CBD in it. But it just seems like hemp oil to me. I think I might have been hoodwinked.

Every CBD product is lab tested for quality and potency, and there is a QR code on each product to see third-party test results and confirm that the CBD product you select meets regulatory requirements.

<p>For a product to legally be considered hemp oil, there must be less than 0.3% THC in the CBD products. Since CBD oil includes the full spectrum of cannabinoids, it can produce what experts call an entourage effect ,” where multiple compounds work together to create more intense and possibly more beneficial effects than each compound could have individually. CBD products are not well regulated, so there can be inconsistencies in how much CBD is in a product. CBD, though, does not contain the chemical in marijuana that makes people high.</p>
