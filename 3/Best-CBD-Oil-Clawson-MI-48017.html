Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>

An important consideration here is that street cannabis often contains a much higher THC content (and thus less CBD): this skunk” is what the majority of UK cannabis users are using. It can be taken orally, but CBD oil for topical use is often recommended for muscle and joint pain. These tests screen for any bacteria, pesticides, and other harmful substances that can contaminate the CBD oils. For most people, price is a huge factor in decision making when purchasing products.</p>
