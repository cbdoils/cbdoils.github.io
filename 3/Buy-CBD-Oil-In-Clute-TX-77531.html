<p>This study found CBD has anti-anxiety properties. Though often used interchangeably, hemp oil and CBD oil have crucial differences in how each one affects your body and health. You must be careful to use only CBD oil to treat any anxiety-related conditions, as any traces of THC can increase anxiety and have the reverse of the desired effect.
