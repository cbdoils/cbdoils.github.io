<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN). In a 2016 study , Scott Shannon and his fellow researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins demonstrated that CBD oil can be safely and effectively used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders in children with PTSD.</p>
<p>Still, not all companies guarantee that their CBD products come from hemp. CBD oil does not stimulate the appetite in the same way medical marijuana can. This requires patients to obtain a verified medical marijuana card prior to purchasing CBD oil. The vast majority of CBD oils come in bottles measuring either 15 milliliters (mL), or 0.5 ounces; or 30 mL, or 1 ounce. An extensive review conducted in 2014 concluded that CBD might be a viable treatment option for osteoarthritis (OA) pain. CBD, or cannabidiol, is among the most abundant of over 100 cannabinoids naturally found in cannabis plants.</p>

For e.g. 10ml of CBD Oil stating 10% CBD contains 90% carrier oil (such as Hemp Seed Oil) and 10% CBD. Hempseed oil can be used topically for skin health , and it can be taken orally as a supplement or food additive. With wide-ranging health benefits—from easing joint discomfort, to making everyday stress more manageable, to promoting better sleep, and more— premium CBD oil is worth taking a look at for your health and well-being.</p>
<p>First and foremost—CBD Oil doesn't have scientific support for half the health claims I hear being attributed to it. I first heard of CBD oil years ago when children with drug-resistant seizures were finding miraculous results. Sativex, an oral spray consisting of CBD and THC, has been proven to be a safe and effective way to reduce muscle spasticity in people with multiple sclerosis. Researchers again found that the CBD gel reduced both joint pain and inflammation without any side effects. Click here to dive deeper on CBD oil and pain.</p>
