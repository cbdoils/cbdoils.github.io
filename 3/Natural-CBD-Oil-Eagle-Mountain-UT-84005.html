<p>CBD has many potential uses and positive effects on the body and mind. Ingested CBD Swallowing CBD oil allows it to pass through the digestive system and be metabolized by the liver, sending its active compounds throughout the body over several hours. However, unlike its well-known cousin Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD) doesn't have any psychotic effects. Doctors have often advised people with chronic anxiety to avoid cannabis, as THC can trigger or amplify feelings of anxiousness and paranoia.
