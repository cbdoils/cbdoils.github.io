Coffee shops sell CBD lattes, spas offer CBD facials, beauty companies are rushing to release lotions with CBD or hemp oils in their formulas. Much of the CBD used medicinally around the world comes from the hemp plant, and not from psychoactive marijuana. A 2016 study published in The Permanente Journal examined the effectiveness of CBD oil for Pediatric anxiety and insomnia as part of post-traumatic stress disorder.

<p>There's more — anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune conditions — CBD is worth a look in any disease process that's rooted in inflammation (which is most of them).
