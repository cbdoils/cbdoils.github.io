<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. Most promisingly, in a recent study, one in 10 users reported that CBD cured their chronic anxiety, making it the ultimate chill pill. As always, discuss with your healthcare provider before starting any new medications or supplements to ensure that there are no interactions with your current medication and treatment regimens. Sometimes companies forget to post it — you can call or send a formal request to check it. If the company refuses to show you the lab report, it is a strong reason not to buy any products from them.</p>
<p>By augmenting the body's own cannabinoids, CBD and the other trace cannabinoids found in hemp oil are able to stimulate the endocannabinoid system to encourage balance and optimal functioning. However, when used in moderate amounts, most people do not experience these side effects, and none of them are known for being fatal or particularly dangerous. Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>

CBD is a compound that interacts with your endocannabinoid system and other vital systems in your body to help manage stress and alter pain perception. CBD research is ongoing, and while larger clinical trials are necessary to confirm, plenty of studies show promise in using CBD oil to treat a variety of health issues. It comes from the cannabis plant; however, unlike its counterpart, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the 'high' from marijuana, CBD, derived from the hemp plant, is non-intoxicating and some believe it may have potential health and wellness benefits.</p>
