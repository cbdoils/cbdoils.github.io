<p>The terms hemp extract and CBD oil are pretty much synonymous. This makes them more responsible for the body's response to pain and inflammation. For e.g. 10ml of CBD Oil stating 10% CBD contains 90% carrier oil (such as Hemp Seed Oil) and 10% CBD.

<p>It's important to know that although THC and CBD are the most studied components of cannabis, there are many more chemical compounds found within the plant, such as the phytocannabinoids cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), as well as terpenes and flavonoids. CBD oil is an isolated extraction of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol.
