In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
