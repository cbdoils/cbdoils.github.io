<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Another huge benefit that comes with using CBD as a pain reliever is that it has no meaningful interactions with opioids, meaning it won't impact the effects of regular painkillers and can be taken alongside them. As with other wellness products, there is no one-size-fits-all serving amount for CBD. CBD is one of 104 chemical compounds, known as cannabinoids, that can be found in the cannabis plant. Soft Gels: CBD soft gels and tablets are a very easy to dose method of incorporating CBD and making use of its health benefits.</p>

<h2>What Is CBD Oil in Danville?</h2>
<p>CBD and THC act as external stimulants that have similar effects on this very powerful body system, causing different kinds of reactions on different parts of the body. THC is the psychoactive part of cannabis and marijuana that gives that "high" associated with those products. However, further research is needed to determine CBD's other benefits and safety. No. Unlike marijuana or other cannabis products, THC doesn't have the psychoactive cannabinoid associated with the high‚Äù feeling most people are familiar with.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol can only be included in "cosmetic" products and only if it contains less than 0.3% THC. That's why all of our products are made using locally-grown hemp, extracted using eco-friendly solvent free CO2, and free from harmful chemical byproducts. CO2 extraction doesn't require additional solvents, which helps to keep the CBD oils clean and pure. Our Virgin cannabis sativa hemp oil is a hemp seed oil, and our Premium hemp oil products, have hemp oil from the stem of the plant (which is listed in milligrams on the bottle) It also has hemp seed oil in the bottle to act as a carrier oil.</p>

A laboratory test-tube study showed that CBD might help block the production of excess skin oils and the inflammatory response that leads to acne.
