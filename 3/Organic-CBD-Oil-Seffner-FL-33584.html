<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. CBD oil offers many potential benefits and can be taken in a variety of ways. Although clinical trials on humans ascertaining the effectiveness of CBD oil for depression are rare, animal model studies, such as these ones from 2014 , 2018 , and 2019 , indicate that it could have similar success as the use of CBD for anxiety has. To be sure that you're getting a product that is legal across all 50 states, you need to double-check that your CBD extracts are made using hemp and contain less than 0.3% THC. For example, a product known as polyethylene glycol is often used in CBD vape oils.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the trace amounts of THC in full spectrum CBD oil could compromise a drug test. However, more clinical data must be collected in order to develop effective protocols in which oils for anxiety (and depression) can be used as a practical form of therapy. A burgeoning body of studies and research is focusing on CBD's effects on asthma.

Chronic pain is one of the primary reasons why people are drawn to hemp oil. Zuardi, A. W., Shirakawa, I., Finkelfarb, E., and Karniol, I. G. Action of cannabidiol on the anxiety and other effects produced by delta 9-THC in normal subjects.
