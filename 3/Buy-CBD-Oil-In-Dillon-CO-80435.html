<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. The resulting product has a higher concentration of CBD than the raw extract, hence the term CBD-rich oil. They source their organic hemp from Colorado and they submit their products to third-party labs to test their purity and safety. Furthermore, while THC binds with CB1 receptors of your body to produce a sense of euphoria, CBD interferes with the binding of THC, reducing its psychoactive effects. For recovery from difficult workouts, the anti-inflammatory effects of CBD oil may be helpful in healing the damage.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the trace amounts of THC in full spectrum CBD oil could compromise a drug test. However, more clinical data must be collected in order to develop effective protocols in which oils for anxiety (and depression) can be used as a practical form of therapy. A burgeoning body of studies and research is focusing on CBD's effects on asthma. CBD isolate can be consumed directly or used as an additive in other preparations such as edibles and beverages; however, it is devoid of the beneficial terpenes and other cannabinoids found naturally in the plant.</p>
