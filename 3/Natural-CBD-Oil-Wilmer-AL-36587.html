<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. They claim that they make no distinction between CBD derived from marijuana and CBD derived from hemp, and since the state has set up no regulations under the 2018 Agricultural Act regarding hemp, even CBD derived from hemp is illegal unless it's purchased from a licensed medical cannabis dispensary. Scientists have identified over 113 different cannabinoids in cannabis sativa, and each interacts with the endocannabinoid system in a slightly different way, offering potential therapeutic benefits. CBD hemp oil comes in seemingly endless forms, each with a different concentration of CBD and other phytocannabinoids.</p>
<p>Derived from the stalk and seed of cannabis (hemp) plants, hemp oil is a natural botanical concentrate that is high in the compound CBD. Medical studies have suggested that CBD has a multitude of benefits for various health conditions. In an earlier study, researchers found that CBD treatment can prevent 56 percent of diabetic mice from developing diabetes. Anecdotally, CBD oil benefits are plentiful. The product that you shared has whole plant extract instead of just CBD mixed with a flavouring agent and carrier oil.</p>

CBD oil is legal in the United States if produced using industrial hemp or hemp imported from Europe as it contains less than 0.3 percent of the psychoactive element in the cannabis plant, known as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). If you'd like to use CBD oil to help ease your arthritis pain, you may be wondering how much to administer or apply.

CBD is already being added to many skincare products, and studies have shown it could also become a treatment for acne vulgaris, the most common type of acne.</p>
