<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Aside from CBD products, it is also used to produce textiles, clothing, fuel, food products, bioplastics, and a range of other materials and goods. However, it's illegal for it to be on general sale in the UK. Medical marijuana contains controlled levels of THC, which is the ingredient from the marijuana plant that causes a so-called 'high'. Most people use CBD oil by ingesting it with the help of a dripper. Cannabis containing 0.3 percent or less of THC is hemp.

We'll be taking a look at where you can buy CBD products and how they stack up against each other. CBD still face stiff opposition from people and parties that are not aware of its immense benefits. One Atlantic contributor explains that it's hard to get a CBD buzz from food because many of the products just don't contain enough CBD.</p>

Many studies - both animal and human - have examined the link between CBD and pain relief, which are thought to be down to the oil's ability to reduce inflammation and interact with neurotransmitters.
