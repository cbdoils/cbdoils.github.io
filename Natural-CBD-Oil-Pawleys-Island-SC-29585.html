<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. The resulting product has a higher concentration of CBD than the raw extract, hence the term CBD-rich oil. They source their organic hemp from Colorado and they submit their products to third-party labs to test their purity and safety. Furthermore, while THC binds with CB1 receptors of your body to produce a sense of euphoria, CBD interferes with the binding of THC, reducing its psychoactive effects.
