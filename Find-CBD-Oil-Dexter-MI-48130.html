<p>Hemp seed oil is another effective extraction solvent and a carrier vehicle that mixes well with CBD. CBD hemp oil can be extracted from both the hemp and cannabis plant, but the former contains3 percent THC or less, and therefore bypasses the legal issues associated with cannabis production.

<p>Sometimes CBD products don't contain any CBD at all — in which case you won't experience any effects, positive or negative. In Europe and the UK, products containing CBD must be derived exclusively from hemp, while also containing no more than 0.2% THC (some countries allow up to 0.3% THC). So in summary, as far as we can tell there are not any real” CBD oils for sale on Amazon. Holly Bell, director of cannabis for Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, uses CBD oil regularly — something she stumbled upon awhile back while living in Tennessee.</p>
