Once extracted from hemp or cannabis, CBD can be added to several products, including tinctures, lotions, and oils. As mentioned earlier, CBD products are available in both hemp-based and marijuana-based formulas. The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) is a series of receptors found throughout the body - brain, immune system, central nervous system and more - that respond to cannabinoids the body produces, as well as cannabinoids from plant sources (such as hemp).</p>
<p>CBD and THC interact with different receptors and create contrastingly different effects in the body.

As a reminder, CBD products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. In states where medical marijuana or recreational marijuana is legal, marijuana-derived CBD may also be available. The purification process further removes any THC present, but as CBD is derived from cannabis, there will always be minute traces of THC remaining.</p>
