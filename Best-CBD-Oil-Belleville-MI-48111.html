<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Because CBD is non-psychoactive, you cannot get high from CBD products. Royal CBD oil is a premium full-spectrum extract with powerfully analgesic terpenes, cannabinoids, and plant sterols. The healthy fats found in these mixes allow the body to better process the cannabidiol, optimizing CBD benefits.
